session5_0L 1 6 213.42 219.868 WHEN SHE COULD NOT MAKE A RABBIT OR A BIRD LOOK REAL ON PAPER SHE SEARCHED IN HER FATHER'S BOOKS FOR PICTURES OF ITS BONES
session5_0L 1 7 268.588 284.38 THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAH MORRIS WITH THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARY
session5_0L 1 4 308.62 313.86 HER FACE WAS AN ENIGMA FOR IT INSPIRED EVERYONE WITH THE WARMEST SYMPATHY
session5_0L 1 4 313.86 320.1 AND YET IF YOU EXAMINED IT ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURE
session5_0L 1 4 320.1 324.716 SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
session5_0L 1 6 327.084 331.444 I WILL MAKE NO UNJUST USE OF WHAT I KNOW HE REPLIED WITH FIRMNESS

session8_0L 1 4 444.500625 453.924625 A STAGE MEAL IS POPULAR BECAUSE IT PROVES TO THE AUDIENCE THAT THE ACTORS EVEN ONE CALLED CHARLES HOLTRY OR OWEN NAIRS ARE REAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU AND ME
session8_0L 1 1 456.612625 457.912625 BUT IN SUCH A CASE MS

session9_0L 1 6 175.852 181.948 THEN SHE GAVE ROSALIE BACK HER MAGIC RING THANKING THE KIND WITCH FOR ALL SHE HAD DONE FOR THEM
session9_0L 1 1 184.204 186.668 HOW IT WILL SHINE THIS EVENING
session9_0L 1 4 203.884 222.264 THIS MEANT THAT FOR AN ALLEGED MISDEMEANOR FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF SIX MONTHS' IMPRISONMENT AND A FINE OF $300 A MAN MIGHT BE IMPRISONED FOR LIFE AYE FOR MANY TERMS OF A MAN'S NATURAL LIFE DID THE COURT'S POWER TO ENFORCE ITS SENTENCES EXTEND SO

session9_0L 1 3 437.692 442.268 THAT A STYLE IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS

session4_0S 1 5 289.648 297.148 BUT IN EGYPT THE TRADITIONS OF OUR OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOREVER IN OUR TEMPLES

session4_0S 1 2 389.212 402.332 ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT
session4_0S 1 1 411.852 414.7 MISS LAKE DECLINED THE CARRIAGE TONIGHT
session4_0S 1 3 427.516 428.828 I WILL PRACTICE IT

session4_0S 1 4 530.508 532.548 THE SCENE IS ABSOLUTELY ARCADIAN
session4_0S 1 4 532.548 535.808 HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON
session4_0S 1 4 535.808 545.248 LOST HOLY IN GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATSOEVER
session4_0S 1 4 545.248 549.868 PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE AND MARVELOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH THE MIST

session4_0S 1 4 16.375875 20.095875 EXQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND LIGHT
session4_0S 1 4 20.095875 23.155875 THIS IS THE FAITH AND EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRYSTAL
session4_0S 1 4 23.155875 36.435875 AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHAUCER IN HIS TENDER MOOD AND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER
session4_0S 1 4 36.435875 43.175875 IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NO SPECIALTY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR
session4_0S 1 1 51.303875 53.223875 CHELFORD HAD A NOTE FOR MR
session4_0S 1 1 53.223875 62.695875 WILDER THIS MORNING—ANOTHER NOTE—HIS COMING DELAYED AND SOMETHING OF HIS HAVING TO SEE SOME PERSON WHO IS ABROAD CONTINUED DORKUS AFTER A LITTLE PAUSE
session4_0S 1 1 70.631875 76.759875 THIS TRANSIENT SPRING AND LIGHTING UP ARE BEAUTIFUL A GLAMOUR BEGUILING OUR SENSES

session4_0S 1 6 98.327875 100.907875 THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT
session4_0S 1 6 100.907875 103.623875 MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE
session4_0S 1 6 107.255875 113.415875 GOOBERS DON'T GROW ON THE TOPS OF VINES BUT ON THE GROUND ON THE ROOTS LIKE YAMS
session4_0S 1 6 113.415875 115.495875 IS THAT SO
session4_0S 1 5 116.935875 128.995875 HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSIOLOGY
session4_0S 1 5 128.995875 143.927875 HE CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUX OF SENSE
session4_0S 1 2 145.671875 160.551875 IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
session4_0S 1 1 164.679875 174.279875 OF MARK WILDER I SAY THIS HIS NAME HAS BEEN FOR YEARS HATEFUL TO ME AND RECENTLY IT HAS BECOME FRIGHTFUL AND YOU WILL PROMISE

session4_0S 1 0 209.575875 212.487875 AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO
session4_0S 1 5 229.991875 234.991875 PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO
session4_0S 1 5 234.991875 237.335875 PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART
session4_0S 1 0 246.839875 248.799875 IT BLAZED UP FAMOUSLY
session4_0S 1 3 248.799875 250.887875 HELP HELP

session4_0S 1 7 275.639875 280.967875 DO WE REALLY KNOW THE MOUNTAIN WELL WHEN WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE CAVERN
session4_0S 1 2 296.903875 305.303875 SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM
session4_0S 1 7 306.919875 309.527875 IT IS THE LANGUAGE OF WRETCHEDNESS
session4_0S 1 1 324.791875 328.199875 BRAFTON'S A VERY GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASSURE YOU
session4_0S 1 3 329.799875 333.559875 THE SIGHTSEERS RETURNED IN HIGH SPIRITS FROM THE CITY
session4_0S 1 7 336.119875 339.959875 ONE THINKS ONE HEARS HYDRAS TALKING
session4_0S 1 4 342.695875 350.471875 THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL
session4_0S 1 4 351.399875 358.551875 AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
session4_0S 1 1 367.239875 371.287875 THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
session4_0S 1 3 382.311875 386.511875 DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I REALLY
session4_0S 1 1 386.511875 389.671875 CAN'T TELL BUT HE'LL SOON TIRE OF COUNTRY LIFE
session4_0S 1 4 401.959875 412.311875 YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN TITIAN HOLBEIN TURNER AND TINTORETTE IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS
session4_0S 1 4 414.135875 419.447875 THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL  DRAWN FIGURES
session4_0S 1 4 420.535875 423.935875 THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND
session4_0S 1 4 423.935875 427.495875 IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
session4_0S 1 0 427.495875 433.175875 BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE TREE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR
session4_0S 1 1 444.711875 448.263875 WELL SHE WAS BETTER THOUGH SHE HAD HAD A BAD NIGHT
session4_0S 1 5 460.951875 464.731875 WITH HERACLITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX
session4_0S 1 5 464.731875 474.931875 LIKE ANAXAGORAS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING
session4_0S 1 5 474.931875 481.131875 LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
session4_0S 1 5 481.131875 485.771875 AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION
session4_0S 1 5 485.771875 489.651875 HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
session4_0S 1 5 489.651875 497.255875 WELL THE GENEALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANNUAL SALA ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORY
session4_0S 1 7 500.007875 502.231875 LOOK CLOSELY AT LIFE
session4_0S 1 0 508.551875 513.031875 AND THE WHOLE NIGHT THE TREE STOOD STILL AND IN DEEP THOUGHT
session4_0S 1 0 513.031875 520.343875 DON'T YOU KNOW ONE ABOUT BACON AND TALLOW CANDLES CAN'T YOU TELL ANY LOUDER STORIES
session4_0S 1 7 522.343875 527.159875 IT IS SO MADE THAT EVERYWHERE WE FEEL THE SENSE OF PUNISHMENT
session4_0S 1 7 528.279875 531.047875 WHY SHOULD ONE HALT ON THE WAY
session4_0S 1 6 551.847875 556.347875 FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID AGAPE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT
session4_0S 1 6 556.347875 559.079875 THEN LEANED DIZZILY AGAINST A TREE
session4_0S 1 2 565.799875 574.551875 HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY
session4_0S 1 0 581.671875 590.375875 IN THE COURTYARD SOME OF THE MARRIED CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
session4_0S 1 3 596.487875 598.607875 FATHER THESE UNJUST TO PHILIP
session4_0S 1 3 598.607875 600.624125 HE'S GOING INTO BUSINESS
session5_0S 1 1 10.315999999999999 12.216 THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED
session5_0S 1 1 12.216 20.748 EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METER
session5_0S 1 7 31.628 36.86 MARGARET BOLTON ALMOST LOST FOR A MOMENT HER HABITUAL PLACIDITY
session5_0S 1 6 42.764 56.264 AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITIES AND INFIRMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH A VIEW TO REMEDY IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH CHOICE IS PERMITTED
session5_0S 1 0 56.264 58.972 I DON'T ANTICIPATE
session5_0S 1 4 66.428 70.688 PEARL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
session5_0S 1 4 70.688 81.772 THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND
session5_0S 1 1 83.42 98.14 THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE  WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING
session5_0S 1 1 100.172 108.192 THE STANDARD EDISON METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION
session5_0S 1 1 108.192 111.516 ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED
session5_0S 1 3 117.996 122.196 'DEAR ME' EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT
session5_0S 1 3 122.196 125.084 'AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO'
session5_0S 1 7 134.38 142.268 HE WELL KNEW THE PERILS OF THE FRONTIER THE SAVAGE STATE OF SOCIETY THE LURKING INDIANS AND THE DANGERS OF FEVER
session5_0S 1 3 145.116 146.016 THANK YOU
session5_0S 1 3 146.016 147.852 HE RETURNED SHORTLY
session5_0S 1 0 152.54 153.94 HEREDITY
session5_0S 1 0 153.94 156.38 THE CAUSE OF ALL OUR FAULTS
session5_0S 1 1 160.62 186.252 THERE WAS INFINITE SKEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION
session5_0S 1 6 188.892 204.212 TO KEEP AFLOAT AND TO RESCUE FROM OBLIVION TO HOLD ABOVE THE GULF WERE IT BUT A FRAGMENT OF SOME LANGUAGE WHICH MAN HAS SPOKEN AND WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST THAT IS TO SAY ONE
session5_0S 1 6 204.212 216.732 OF THE ELEMENTS GOOD OR BAD OF WHICH CIVILIZATION IS COMPOSED OR BY WHICH IT IS COMPLICATED TO EXTEND THE RECORDS OF SOCIAL OBSERVATION
session5_0S 1 6 217.58 219.74 OF CIVILIZATION ITSELF
session5_0S 1 5 226.044 228.156 HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
session5_0S 1 6 233.452 239.612 TO BURN WITHOUT CEASING TO FLY THEREIN LIES THE MARVEL OF GENIUS
session5_0S 1 2 247.388 252.608 OF THIS PARTY EDWARD A BOY OF SEVENTEEN CALLED FORTH MUCH SYMPATHY
session5_0S 1 2 252.608 255.372 HE TOO WAS CLAIMED BY HOLLAND
session5_0S 1 6 274.252 279.452 THIS WITHOUT RECKONING IN THE PAINS OF THE HEART AND SO IT GOES ON
session5_0S 1 6 283.98 291.7 THE SUGAR MANUFACTURER WHO SAYS LOAF CLARIFIED LUMPS BASTARD COMMON BURNT
session5_0S 1 6 291.7 295.916 THIS HONEST MANUFACTURER TALKS SLANG
session5_0S 1 3 303.26 306.652 IT WOULD SERVE YOU ALL RIGHT IF SHE WALKED OFF WITH CARL
session5_0S 1 0 308.012 322.268 HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENTS A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED
session5_0S 1 1 342.156 356.412 UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERN AND REGULATE IT THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP EDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT
session5_0S 1 5 361.212 369.724 DELIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDANCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS
session5_0S 1 5 371.596 383.052 TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
session5_0S 1 4 392.156 394.412 YE MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW
session5_0S 1 6 410.028 412.332 PHOENICIAN VERY GOOD

session5_0S 1 2 449.484 453.624 AND IN THIS LAST ACTION HE FALLS INTO THE CLASSIC SIN OF PRIDE
session5_0S 1 2 453.624 458.412 PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR THIS UNDERHANDED WAY OF ADMITTING THAT I HAD TURNED 40
session5_0S 1 4 464.428 481.1 GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONORED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARENT FOREVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN
session5_0S 1 3 497.884 504.044 I WISH YOU WEREN'T SO RESTLESS AND DIDN'T GET SO WORKED UP OVER THINGS SHE SAID SADLY
session5_0S 1 7 507.868 519.836 RUTH ASKED THE ENTHUSIASTS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN SUCH A SOUNDING MAUSOLEUM WITH ITS GREAT HALLS AND ECHOING ROOMS AND NO COMFORTABLE PLACE IN IT FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF ANYBODY
session5_0S 1 6 525.788 536.204 HE WOULD BE LIKE A PHILOLOGIST REFUSING TO EXAMINE A FACT IN LANGUAGE A PHILOSOPHER HESITATING TO SCRUTINIZE A FACT IN HUMANITY
session5_0S 1 7 550.204 553.904 QUITE STILL FOR A TIME WITH FACE INTENT AND FLUSHED

session5_0S 1 5 58.44525 66.74925 AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
session5_0S 1 3 81.40525 83.96525 I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE WET SEASON TOO THEN

session1_OV10 1 7 335.452 342.988 BUT IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED AS WASTEFUL

session1_OV10 1 6 429.696 433.616 BUT THE BLUES WHO WERE ASSEMBLED THERE ALL LAUGHED AT THEM AND JEERED THEM
session1_OV10 1 6 433.616 438.748 FOR THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN ALL THE BLUE COUNTRY WHO LOVED THE PRINCESSES THE LEAST LITTLE BIT

session1_OV10 1 4 521.932 524.882 SHE CEASED AND SMILED IN TEARS
session1_OV10 1 4 524.882 527.948 THEN SAT DOWN IN HER SILVER SHRINE
session1_OV10 1 3 535.948 547.212 IN ALL EARLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART

session4_OV10 1 2 327.516 339.116 THE ARC LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PREMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS

session4_OV10 1 0 419.996 425.884 BUT IN THIS VIGNETTE COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPLES BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY
session4_OV10 1 7 441.148 444.476 HOW KIND MAN IS AFTER ALL
session4_OV10 1 7 447.308 450.332 BUT I SHALL TELL ONLY ONE STORY
session4_OV10 1 0 453.852 457.9 DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOL IS AN EASY ONE
session4_OV10 1 4 470.588 475.368 SATURDAY AUGUST 15TH THE SEA UNBROKEN ALL ROUND
session4_OV10 1 4 475.368 477.452 NO LAND IN SIGHT
session4_OV10 1 2 485.34 489.76 BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE  WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY
session4_OV10 1 2 489.76 502.58 BROAD AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IDIOSYNCRATICALLY OPPOSED TO LOOSE AND WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE
session4_OV10 1 2 502.58 512.96 IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTROPLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE CURRENT
session4_OV10 1 2 512.96 519.9 THE METER CONTINUED IN GENERAL SERVICE DURING 1899 AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY
session4_OV10 1 2 519.9 534.332 THE LONDON PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN 3 000 LAMPS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUCT
session4_OV10 1 7 536.796 540.22 AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REVERIE
session4_OV10 1 5 565.1 569.08 THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS GROAN AT THIS AND MUCH REPROACH
session4_OV10 1 5 569.08 572.812 AFTER WHICH IN HIS PREOCCUPIED WAY HE EXPLAINED
session4_OV10 1 6 592.796 599.868 THE ATTENDANCE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FOR SEEING GREAT SUCCESS FOR THEIR FIGHT
session4_OV10 1 7 3.5 7.870000000000001 WHY ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE AND SET TO WORK IN THE LOFT
session4_OV10 1 0 22.03 31.326 THE COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PARQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK

session4_OV10 1 0 58.91 62.29 THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND
session4_OV10 1 0 62.29 66.35 IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL

session4_OV10 1 6 121.418 126.178 ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEY CLICKED IN THE LOCK
session4_OV10 1 3 126.178 132.27 HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE
session4_OV10 1 5 144.686 148.606 FOR STILL TEMPTATION FOLLOWS WHERE THOU ART
session4_OV10 1 7 155.566 159.118 WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT THE TREE
session4_OV10 1 1 177.774 180.222 BY REASON AND AFFECTION
session4_OV10 1 3 196.798 204.846 ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS PSALM TO BE SUNG
session4_OV10 1 0 223.598 233.87 SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRYSTALLIZE HARD AT THE EDGE
session4_OV10 1 5 236.67 237.81 ANGER
session4_OV10 1 5 237.81 238.79 PAIN
session4_OV10 1 5 238.79 241.15 PAINFUL TO HEAR
session4_OV10 1 2 252.334 259.054 WHY IF WE ERECT A STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
session4_OV10 1 2 272.222 284.162 HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES
session4_OV10 1 2 284.162 292.158 HE WEIGHED AND RE  WEIGHED THE METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
session4_OV10 1 6 309.742 318.75 A WEAK NEED CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM OPPOSITION
session4_OV10 1 0 325.87 328.814 THE CRAMPNESS AND THE POVERTY ARE ALL INTENDED
session4_OV10 1 6 344.702 354.398 THE FAIRVIEW BAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCE AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAXED TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESTS
session4_OV10 1 3 356.062 376.522 FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVENANTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELCHO WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION
session4_OV10 1 3 376.522 398.302 THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS
session4_OV10 1 1 399.758 411.198 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
session4_OV10 1 1 411.198 415.938 THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED
session4_OV10 1 1 415.938 419.938 TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE

session4_OV10 1 7 477.422 486.158 IN THE COURTYARD SOME OF THE MERRY CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
session4_OV10 1 4 509.934 513.182 ONE MIGHT BE WITH LESS REASON THAN NOW
session4_OV10 1 6 533.998 537.39 HE IS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHECKS OF THE CONCERN
session4_OV10 1 3 539.822 550.442 AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE TEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE
session4_OV10 1 3 550.442 565.55 WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOUR
session4_OV10 1 3 572.318 593.038 WITH THESE AND SOME REINFORCEMENTS OF THE ATHOL MEN AND MACDONALD'S WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGYLL'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD
session4_OV10 1 2 599.278 600.818 THERE MESSRS
session4_OV10 1 2 600.818 611.914 JOHNSON AND HAMMER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
session5_OV10 1 1 8.396 20.38 UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAIC OF JET AND YELLOW FLAGSTONES
session5_OV10 1 5 25.292 27.512 SHE WAS TIRED OF OTHER THINGS
session5_OV10 1 5 27.512 29.112 IS HE GOING TO START A DAILY
session5_OV10 1 3 29.112 32.172 NEWSPAPER AMONG THE KICKAPOOS FAREWELL MADAME
session5_OV10 1 1 38.044 45.628 SURFACE DUST AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISH
session5_OV10 1 0 48.332 51.1 IS THERE NOT A MERIDIAN EVERYWHERE
session5_OV10 1 2 57.036 60.736 IT IS SO MADE THAT EVERYWHERE WE FEEL THE SENSE OF PUNISHMENT
session5_OV10 1 2 60.736 66.79599999999999 THERE IS THE SLANG OF THE AFFECTED LADY AS WELL AS OF THE PRESS USERS
session5_OV10 1 4 71.132 78.012 WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE
session5_OV10 1 4 78.012 93.468 BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD
session5_OV10 1 5 99.452 102.428 HE WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE
session5_OV10 1 2 106.876 109.02 LOOK CLOSELY AT LIFE
session5_OV10 1 5 118.812 126.7 HE WELL KNEW THE PERILS OF THE FRONTIER THE SAVAGE STATE OF SOCIETY THE LURKING INDIANS AND THE DANGERS OF FEVER
session5_OV10 1 6 146.828 150.7 NOW YOU'LL STAY CRIED VAN SAY POLLY WON'T YOU
session5_OV10 1 6 158.572 161.532 I CAN'T PRAY TO HAVE THE THINGS I WANT
session5_OV10 1 6 162.748 167.18 AND I WON'T PRAY NOT TO HAVE THEM NOT IF I'M DAMNED FOR IT
session5_OV10 1 3 169.804 172.644 YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A CAUTION
session5_OV10 1 3 172.644 175.452 THERE CAN BE NO PERIL IN IT FOR HER
session5_OV10 1 0 189.116 192.236 I ADDRESS HIM IN ITALIAN AND HE ANSWERS
session5_OV10 1 0 192.236 197.436 VERY WITTILY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
session5_OV10 1 1 199.244 203.9 IT CAN'T HURT ANYTHING I'M SURE FOR WE WON'T DISTURB THINGS AT ALL
session5_OV10 1 3 246.396 248.696 THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS
session5_OV10 1 3 248.696 255.51599999999996 INDEED THERE WERE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTERS WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SAME RESULT
session5_OV10 1 1 268.812 276.632 THE ENGLISH FORWARDED TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTIFUL PROVISION TO GREET THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS
session5_OV10 1 1 276.632 279.632 THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH
session5_OV10 1 1 279.632 283.372 TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY
session5_OV10 1 1 284.684 288.428 FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCTLY
session5_OV10 1 5 291.34 295.708 IS THY FATHER WILLING THEE SHOULD GO AWAY TO A SCHOOL OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLE
session5_OV10 1 5 301.324 307.868 IT IS SUCH A NOBLE AMBITION THAT IT IS A PITY IT HAS USUALLY SUCH A SHALLOW FOUNDATION
session5_OV10 1 5 308.828 313.308 WHAT A BOX WOMEN ARE PUT INTO MEASURED FOR IT AND PUT IN YOUNG
session5_OV10 1 5 313.308 320.22 IF WE GO ANYWHERE IT'S IN A BOX VEILED AND PINIONED AND SHUT IN BY DISABILITIES
session5_OV10 1 2 337.052 353.232 CAN ONE IMAGINE A NATURALIST REFUSING TO STUDY THE VIPER THE BAT THE SCORPION THE CENTIPEDE THE TARANTULA AND ONE WHO WOULD CAST THEM BACK INTO THEIR DARKNESS SAYING OH HOW UGLY THAT
session5_OV10 1 5 353.232 356.348 IS IF I CAN GET PATIENCE
session5_OV10 1 0 368.892 374.348 I SEE A CROWD IN ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN EVERYBODY STANDING STILL AND LOOKING UP
session5_OV10 1 7 385.5 389.596 I WON'T TREMBLE TOMORROW THOUGHT THE FIR TREE
session5_OV10 1 6 392.78 396.828 OH NO JAPSER I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF
session5_OV10 1 6 403.068 410.848 THAT SUMMER THE RAINS HAD BEEN SO MANY AND OPPORTUNE THAT IT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN SHABATTA AND HIS MEN COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH THE CORN
session5_OV10 1 6 410.848 417.308 THE ORCHARD WAS A NEGLECTED WILDERNESS AND AMIEL MOWED HIS WAY SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD THE CHERRY TREES
session5_OV10 1 6 417.308 422.316 A BRISK WIND HAD COME UP AND WAS DRIVING PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY
session5_OV10 1 5 425.436 433.852 BUT PHILIP DID AFFORD IT AND HE WROTE THANKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID THE POLITICAL SCHEME WOULD FAIL AND OUGHT TO FAIL
session5_OV10 1 3 435.404 437.964 SIR MARCH 16TH
session5_OV10 1 2 441.772 446.956 THIS WITHOUT RECKONING IN THE PAINS OF THE HEART AND SO IT GOES ON
session5_OV10 1 4 459.612 462.796 A FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION
session5_OV10 1 4 465.884 474.668 THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT
session5_OV10 1 3 477.244 485.276 AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID WHILE ON HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT FOR ETERNITY
session5_OV10 1 6 493.244 497.464 JUST SMELL THE WILD ROSES THEY ARE ALWAYS SO SPICY AFTER A RAIN
session5_OV10 1 6 497.464 498.624 THEN DEAR SAID MRS
session5_OV10 1 6 498.624 500.904 WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER
session5_OV10 1 6 500.904 507.996 THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS  HE DROPPED A HANDFUL INTO HER LAP
session5_OV10 1 6 512.62 514.14 OH EVER SO MUCH
session5_OV10 1 6 514.14 517.724 ONLY HE SEEMS KIND OF STAID AND SCHOOLTEACHERY
session5_OV10 1 0 519.084 525.444 WITHOUT SAYING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AN ILLUSTRIOUS MEMBER
session5_OV10 1 0 525.444 526.9439375 OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS
session5_OV10 1 0 526.9439375 531.02 SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT
session5_OV10 1 5 536.508 550.86 I HAVE NOT ASKED HIM RUTH REPLIED WITH A LOOK THAT MIGHT IMPLY THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE DETERMINED LITTLE BODIES WHO FIRST MADE UP HER OWN MIND AND THEN COMPELLED OTHERS TO MAKE UP THEIRS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HERS
session5_OV10 1 6 562.38 566.46 INDEED HE HAD LOOKED AWAY WITH THE PURPOSE OF NOT SEEING
session5_OV10 1 6 577.356 580.988 AREN'T YOU SPLASHED LOOK AT THE SPIDERWEBS ALL OVER THE GRASS
session5_OV10 1 6 591.388 599.708 BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND IF JASPER HADN'T CAUGHT HER JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM THE STOOL FRONZY AND ALL
session5_OV10 1 6 3.5 9.756499999999999 SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
session5_OV10 1 0 19.8045 25.6125 SHE INTRODUCED ME TO ALL HER GUESTS AND GAVE ME SOME PARTICULARS RESPECTING EVERY ONE OF THEM
session5_OV10 1 4 30.6365 39.0365 IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLER
session5_OV10 1 5 44.9405 46.4405 WELL I'M GOING AS AN ENGINEER
session5_OV10 1 5 46.4405 48.4445 YOU COULD GO AS ONE
session5_OV10 1 4 49.6765 57.4365 THE BEHAVIORIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECORD
session5_OV10 1 5 66.5085 73.0685 BUT THAT WISE AND PLACID WOMAN UNDERSTOOD THE SWEET REBEL A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN RUTH UNDERSTOOD HERSELF
session5_OV10 1 1 93.0685 100.3805 IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCOLORED
session5_OV10 1 1 101.7725 104.7525 IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL
session5_OV10 1 1 104.7525 107.3925 IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
session5_OV10 1 3 107.3925 114.8125 UNFORTUNATELY THE FRACTURE COULD NOT BE SET TILL SIX O 'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME
session5_OV10 1 3 114.8125 119.8045 AND SHE NOW LIES AT OUR HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE
session5_OV10 1 2 125.8525 134.8125 WE MAY BE STOPPED THE FACT MAY BE PUT TO US IN GENERAL TERMS WHICH IS ONE WAY OF ATTENUATING IT
session5_OV10 1 2 134.8125 148.0765 WE MAY BE TOLD THAT ALL TRADES PROFESSIONS IT MAY BE ADDED ALL THE ACCIDENTS OF THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY AND ALL FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE HAVE THEIR OWN SIGN
session5_OV10 1 7 149.9805 157.8805 THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID
session5_OV10 1 7 157.8805 160.3325 WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS
session5_OV10 1 1 166.3165 171.2125 NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE WRIST TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
session5_OV10 1 2 173.9485 189.4365 ONE PERCEIVES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING IT A HIDEOUS MURMUR SOUNDING ALMOST LIKE HUMAN ACCENTS BUT MORE NEARLY RESEMBLING A HOWL THAN AN ARTICULATE WORD
session5_OV10 1 2 197.4685 199.6925 IDLE MISSUS THE MOTHER
session5_OV10 1 0 201.1645 217.0245 HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WAS CELEBRATED FOR HIS WITTY REPARTEES AND HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANYONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT
session5_OV10 1 0 217.0245 218.1645 LEAST TWENTY CATS
session5_OV10 1 0 218.1645 220.7845 WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF ALL DAY
session5_OV10 1 0 220.7845 229.9645 MADAME CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONIZING AIR FOR MY PRONUNCIATION OF THE WORD SKEVRA WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE
session5_OV10 1 0 229.9645 241.5245 PRONOUNCED SKURA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT DAY IN MY LIFE
session5_OV10 1 0 241.5245 246.7005 ALL THESE HONEST PERSONS ARE WAITING THEIR TURN TO GET THEIR SNUFF BOXES FILLED
session5_OV10 1 4 254.7645 261.3445 WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST
session5_OV10 1 4 261.3445 270.2525 FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
session5_OV10 1 2 282.0125 282.9325 THANK YOU
session5_OV10 1 6 282.9325 284.7485 HE RETURNED SHORTLY
session5_OV10 1 7 287.9485 291.8525 AND TOWARDS CHRISTMAS HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THAT WAS CUT DOWN
session5_OV10 1 3 294.9725 300.6925 AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I NEVER DARE RECKON WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENJOYMENT OF A PLEASURE AGAIN
session5_OV10 1 3 300.6925 304.4445 IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITY STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME
session5_OV10 1 0 317.2765 327.1565 IT SEEMS TO ME I REPLIED THAT SUCH APPROVAL SUCH RATIFICATION OF THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY THE KING THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ETC
session5_OV10 1 0 327.1565 331.6965 IS RATHER A PROOF OF THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION
session5_OV10 1 0 331.6965 337.6605 FOR THE FRENCH CARRY THAT AFFECTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY BELIEVE THEM INFALLIBLE
session5_OV10 1 1 355.3405 365.1405 WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL 16TH 1861 AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
session5_OV10 1 1 365.1405 369.8205 A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKE WHERE
session5_OV10 1 1 373.5965 376.3765 I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING

session2_OV20 1 3 56.652 62.432 THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE
session2_OV20 1 3 62.432 73.228 TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
session2_OV20 1 5 76.252 86.908 THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANNISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
session2_OV20 1 4 92.396 96.732 THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT

session3_OV20 1 6 149.332 161.264 NEVERBEND BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERVED THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERALLY ADDRESSED ME AS PRESIDENT IT CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION
session3_OV20 1 5 171.6 173.46 I THANK ALL WHO HAVE LOVED
session3_OV20 1 5 173.46 177.2 ME IN THEIR HEARTS WITH THANKS AND LOVE FROM MA
session3_OV20 1 4 183.392 184.832 WHO SUNK HIS SHIP IN MEN
session3_OV20 1 4 184.832 186.16 THAN HIM WE BROUGHT TO YOU
session3_OV20 1 6 191.696 193.116 YOU MAY BE QUITE SURE IT'S
session3_OV20 1 6 193.116 202.88 THERE SAID CAPTAIN BATTLEAXE AND THAT I CAN SO USE IT AS TO HALF OBLITERATE YOUR TOWN WITHIN TWO MINUTES OF MY RETURN ON BOARD BUT I MEAN TO HAVE MY INNINGS BEFORE LONG
session3_OV20 1 4 218.176 220.432 AT ANOTHER TIME HAROLD ASKED
session3_OV20 1 4 221.696 224.752 SO I SET GUARDS OVER EVERYONE IN THAT HOUSE
session3_OV20 1 5 232.16 236.944 THE CLOUD THEN SHOWED HIS GOLDEN HEAD AND HIS BRIGHT FORM EMERGED
session3_OV20 1 1 241.6 248.064 SHE'S OLDER THAN I AM BUT SO TINY AND SAD AND SHY THAT SHE SEEMS LIKE A CHILD
session3_OV20 1 0 260.144 268.416 FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED THE LINE HITHERTO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COAST OF ALGERIA BUT NO LAND APPEARED TO THE SOUTH
session3_OV20 1 0 271.808 276.888 ITS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS
session3_OV20 1 0 276.888 284.528 AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASSIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARREN OF MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE
session3_OV20 1 6 301.056 310.556 YOU WILL CARRY OUT WITH YOU 100 MEN OF THE NORTH NORTHWEST BIRMINGHAM REGIMENT WHICH WILL PROBABLY SUFFICE FOR YOUR OWN SECURITY AS IT IS THOUGHT THAT IF MR
session3_OV20 1 6 310.556 316.48 NEVER  BEEN BE WITHDRAWN THE PEOPLE WILL REVERT EASILY TO THEIR OLD HABITS OF OBEDIENCE
session3_OV20 1 7 324.544 327.484 A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF NITROGEN FILLS THE AIR
session3_OV20 1 7 327.484 328.904 IT ENTERS THE THROAT
session3_OV20 1 7 328.904 330.704 IT FILLS THE LUNGS
session3_OV20 1 7 335.728 340.248 FROM THE UNDERSURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THERE ARE CONTINUAL EMISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT
session3_OV20 1 7 340.248 344.728 ELECTRIC MATTER IS IN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLECULES
session3_OV20 1 7 344.728 348.088 THE GASEOUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED TO BE
session3_OV20 1 7 348.088 351.748 SLAKED WITH MOISTURE FOR INNUMERABLE COLUMNS
session3_OV20 1 7 351.748 356.176 OF WATER RUSH UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM
session3_OV20 1 3 366.56 370.432 THE DELAWARE'S ARE CHILDREN OF THE TORTOISE AND THEY OUTSTRIP THE DEER
session3_OV20 1 5 371.84 376.864 OR AN EYE OF GIFTS AND GRACES SHOWERING FRUIT AND COINED GOLD
session3_OV20 1 3 378.384 384.56 YET HERE ARE WE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SKAROONS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE WE CROSSED
session3_OV20 1 6 387.536 394.096 I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTAIN BATTLEAXE TO TOUCH UPON PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
session3_OV20 1 2 395.808 407.268 THE GOVERNOR ON HIS PART BECOMING DOUBTFUL OF THE LEGALITY OF EMPLOYING MISSOURI MILITIA TO ENFORCE KANSAS LAWS WAS ALSO EAGER TO SECURE THE HELP OF FEDERAL TROOPS
session3_OV20 1 2 407.268 409.568 THIS WAS A FORMABLE ARRAY OF ADVANTAGES
session3_OV20 1 2 409.568 412.64 SLAVERY WAS PLAYING WITH LOADED DICE
session3_OV20 1 2 417.44 429.62 THE WHOLE PROCEEDING WAS SO CHILDISH THE MISERABLE PLOT SO TRANSPARENT THE OUTRAGE SO GROSS AS TO BRING DISGUST TO THE BETTER CLASS OF BORDER RUFFIANS WHO WERE WITNESSES AND ACCESSORIES
session3_OV20 1 7 429.62 432.34 FLIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW
session3_OV20 1 7 432.34 433.84 THE REPTILES ROSE
session3_OV20 1 7 433.84 441.216 THEY WHEELED AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESS TRAINS BUT THERE SEEMED NO REASON OF FEAR
session3_OV20 1 0 455.984 460.336 SERVODAK TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE DOBRYNA WAS ENDEAVORING TO PUT IN
session3_OV20 1 2 463.648 467.928 FROM THESE AGAIN SPRANG BARRICADED AND FORTIFIED DWELLINGS
session3_OV20 1 2 467.928 475.76 CAMPS AND SCOUT PARTIES FINALLY CULMINATING IN ROVING GUERRILLA BANDS HALF PARTISAN HALF PREDATORY
session3_OV20 1 2 478.64 485.68 HE SUMMONED HALF A DOZEN CITIZENS TO JOIN HIS POSSE WHO FOLLOWED OBEYED AND ASSISTED HIM
session3_OV20 1 2 485.68 488.544 TO THEIR SORROW THEY WERE SOON UNDECEIVED
session3_OV20 1 7 494.096 498.72 HE CALLED THIS SEA A POND AND OUR LONG VOYAGE TAKING A LITTLE SAIL
session3_OV20 1 2 505.376 511.008 THE LEADERS OF THE CONSPIRACY BECAME DISTRUSTFUL OF THEIR POWER TO CRUSH THE TOWN
session3_OV20 1 1 513.376 517.356 MY LORD MISS MILLER'S TASTE IS NOT A DEPRAVED ONE
session3_OV20 1 1 517.356 519.356 IT IS BUT TOO REFINED
session3_OV20 1 1 519.356 532.796 MISS WOODLEY WAS TOO LITTLE VERSED IN THE SUBJECT TO KNOW THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN NOT TO LOVE AT ALL AT LEAST NOT TO THE EXTENT OF BREAKING THROUGH ENGAGEMENTS AND ALL THE VARIOUS OBSTACLES THAT STILL MITIGATED AGAINST THEIR UNION
session3_OV20 1 1 532.796 539.168 BUT THE MORE FORGETFULNESS HAD THEN PREVAILED THE MORE POWERFUL WAS THE FORCE OF REMEMBRANCE WHEN SHE AWOKE
session3_OV20 1 6 540.272 542.212 'QUITE SATISFIED' SAID EVA
session3_OV20 1 3 542.212 551.504 'IF YOU ARE NOT THEN KNOCKED ON THE HEAD YOUR BEING A NON  COMPOSER WILL PROTECT YOU AND YOU'LL THEN HAVE A GOOD REASON TO EXPECT TO DIE IN YOUR BED'
session3_OV20 1 4 556.624 558.324 I WISH YOU GOOD NIGHT
session3_OV20 1 4 558.324 560.204 SHE LAID HER BONY HAND ON THE BACK OF MR
session3_OV20 1 4 560.204 568.288 METACROSS'S INVALID CHAIR CUT HIM SHORT IN HIS FAREWELL SALUTATION TO ME AND WHEELED HIM OUT TO HIS BED AS IF SHE WERE WHEELING HIM OUT TO HIS GRAVE
session3_OV20 1 6 569.744 576.976 IT IS FOUNDED ON THE ACKNOWLEDGED WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVED THAT PERIOD OF LIFE AT WHICH MEN CEASED TO WORK
session3_OV20 1 7 583.008 589.788 ITS JAW IS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING TO NATURALISTS IS IRON WITH NO LESS THAN 182 TEETH
session3_OV20 1 7 589.788 591.504 HANS STURZNEI
session3_OV20 1 0 595.296 597.36 THERE'S NO FEAR OF THAT SIR
session4_OV20 1 4 6.204000000000001 12.764 WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST
session4_OV20 1 4 12.764 21.756 FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
session4_OV20 1 2 25.356 35.308 THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND PEACE
session4_OV20 1 2 43.18 51.948 BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL
session4_OV20 1 0 53.1 57.132 THE ARROW PIERCED HIS HEART AND WOUNDED HIM MORTALLY
session4_OV20 1 2 64.50800000000001 67.408 THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
session4_OV20 1 2 67.408 71.328 WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER
session4_OV20 1 2 71.328 74.188 THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN
session4_OV20 1 2 74.188 79.128 THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS
session4_OV20 1 2 79.128 82.148 THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE
session4_OV20 1 2 82.148 87.028 THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
session4_OV20 1 2 87.028 92.108 TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS
session4_OV20 1 2 92.108 94.204 THE ANGELS CANNOT
session4_OV20 1 6 98.956 108.096 AFTER AN APPRENTICESHIP ON MERCHANT SHIP HE HAD ENTERED THE IMPERIAL NAVY AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT WHEN THE COUNT APPOINTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF HIS OWN
session4_OV20 1 6 108.096 111.116 PRIVATE YACHT IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND
session4_OV20 1 6 111.116 119.74 BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME THROUGHOUT THE WINTER GENERALLY CRUISING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WHILST IN THE SUMMER HE VISITED MORE NORTHERN WATERS
session4_OV20 1 0 122.028 129.05200000000002 YOU ARE POSITIVE THEN YES THE CHARACTER WHICH YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS ASSUMED IS IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH YOUR OWN
session4_OV20 1 7 153.276 166.596 IDLE AND BITTERING FINALLY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE CERTITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE BADE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS
session4_OV20 1 7 166.596 168.796 OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE
session4_OV20 1 5 171.18 178.604 IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE COURT  MARTIAL
session4_OV20 1 2 186.124 194.876 ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WRITE AND TEACH AS I DO
session4_OV20 1 6 200.364 205.068 ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE MEDITERRANEAN THERE'S NO FEAR OF THAT SIR
session4_OV20 1 6 207.436 215.356 DOUBTS NOW AROSE AND SOME DISCUSSION FOLLOWED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR BEN ZUF TO ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER
session4_OV20 1 6 217.5 223.532 YOU MUST SEE LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF ALGERIA AS YOU IMAGINED
session4_OV20 1 7 227.628 232.06 THE LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE PAGE WHEREON ANOTHER EQUATION
session4_OV20 1 7 233.708 236.668 SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD ABROAD ITS WHITE
session4_OV20 1 5 246.988 249.428 A BROKEN TIP OF LEAD WOULD LINE THERE ALSO
session4_OV20 1 0 249.428 252.648 IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY
session4_OV20 1 0 252.648 254.844 THE KING FROWNED
session4_OV20 1 2 260.428 264.236 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
session4_OV20 1 3 283.516 288.284 THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE
session4_OV20 1 3 296.716 298.716 ALSO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT
session4_OV20 1 3 298.716 305.716 THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS ARE NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE
session4_OV20 1 3 305.716 310.284 IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDATORY EMPLOYMENTS
session4_OV20 1 5 318.828 322.044 BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
session4_OV20 1 5 331.74 334.04 WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE
session4_OV20 1 5 334.04 335.82 THERE ARE OTHERS
session4_OV20 1 6 337.1 347.852 THE LATE ASTOUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PROCOPE MANIFESTLY UNEASY AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE COUNT SECRETLY PARTOOK OF HIS OWN ANXIETY
session4_OV20 1 2 358.78 368.972 HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM
session4_OV20 1 0 387.932 390.364 WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED LOUISE
session4_OV20 1 3 401.516 409.132 BUT IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERYDAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED AS WASTEFUL
session4_OV20 1 5 411.308 411.888 MR
session4_OV20 1 5 411.888 414.892 PSALMS WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
session4_OV20 1 7 421.66 431.532 HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BULL WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE AT THE POLICE BARRACKS
session4_OV20 1 0 443.292 446.752 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATRE
session4_OV20 1 0 446.752 454.992 BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK
session4_OV20 1 0 454.992 465.452 OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED FROM THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS HEART
session4_OV20 1 0 465.452 467.312 LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING
session4_OV20 1 0 467.312 477.672 AND AS IF COLBERT HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF AU COURANT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS
session4_OV20 1 7 477.672 492.752 IF A MAN HAD STOLEN A POUND IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD USED THAT POUND TO AMASS A HUGE FORTUNE HOW MUCH WAS HE OBLIGED TO GIVE BACK THE POUND HE HAD STOLEN ONLY OR THE POUND TOGETHER WITH THE COMPOUND INTEREST ACCRUING
session4_OV20 1 7 492.752 494.748 UPON IT OR ALL HIS FUTURE
session4_OV20 1 1 500.092 503.052 IS THERE NOT A MERIDIAN EVERYWHERE
session4_OV20 1 6 512.284 520.724 WE DON'T SPIN TOPS IS A FAVORITE SAYING AMONGST ARTILLERY OFFICERS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHIRK THEIR DUTY BY FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS
session4_OV20 1 6 520.724 527.148 BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT CERVODAK BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINNING TOPS
session4_OV20 1 3 534.092 548.052 DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANTS THEREFORE TEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME HONORIFIC AS BEING A MARK AT THE SECONDARY MOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE
session4_OV20 1 3 548.052 562.332 MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE IN TURN ATTACHED TO THEIR PERSONS A MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMER IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ETC
session4_OV20 1 4 568.748 579.548 A GRAMOPHONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMOPHONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
session4_OV20 1 1 582.924 585.904 BUT HOW DID SHE MANAGE TO RENDER IT SO
session4_OV20 1 1 585.904 589.804 FASHIONABLE LET A MAN RUN AND EVERYBODY WILL RUN AFTER HIM
session4_OV20 1 1 589.804 594.404 THE CROWD WILL NOT STOP UNLESS THE MAN HAS PROVED TO BE MAD
session4_OV20 1 1 594.404 599.244 BUT TO PROVE IT IS INDEED A DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE
session4_OV20 1 1 599.244 605.092625 WE HAVE A CROWD OF MEN WHO MAD FROM THEIR BIRTH ARE STILL CONSIDERED WISE
session4_OV20 1 5 3.5 9.523375 WITHOUT HIS SCRAPBOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN
session4_OV20 1 3 20.739375 26.547375 THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY
session4_OV20 1 1 32.835375 41.575375 TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON SYLVIA GAVE A SPLENDID SUPPER TO WHICH SHE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY
session4_OV20 1 1 41.575375 43.491375 FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
session4_OV20 1 3 48.691375 53.043375 THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
session4_OV20 1 5 55.459375 62.599375 HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOLMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED
session4_OV20 1 5 62.599375 64.963375 THANK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME
session4_OV20 1 7 92.499375 101.027375 THEY WERE VOYAGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NOMADS ON THE MARCH VOYAGING HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD BOUND
session4_OV20 1 4 119.603375 122.579375 AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE
session4_OV20 1 6 125.251375 133.871375 BENZOF'S MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH  LOVED HOME
session4_OV20 1 6 133.871375 150.651375 AND SO INCESSANTLY WERE SERVIDAC'S EARS BESIEGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARALLELED BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS EIGHTEENTH ARRONDISSEMENT OF PARIS THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE NAME OF MONTMARTRE WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSION
session4_OV20 1 6 150.651375 156.131375 NO CATHEDRAL NOT EVEN BURGOS ITSELF COULD VIE WITH THE CHURCH AT MONTMARTRE
session4_OV20 1 3 168.147375 173.107375 IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE
session4_OV20 1 3 178.131375 186.627375 SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINER AND HANGARISON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMER WITHOUT QUALIFICATION
session4_OV20 1 1 191.667375 200.243375 IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBEY CONTI AND I HAD OCCASION TO QUOTE TWO LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER
session4_OV20 1 2 204.259375 208.803375 PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD
session4_OV20 1 5 214.435375 218.787375 I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT
session4_OV20 1 3 222.355375 229.379375 THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO AFFECT
session4_OV20 1 6 236.419375 247.739375 THE BOND OF UNION THUS EFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGH BEN ZUF'S ACHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINED ALL HONORS OR ANY
session4_OV20 1 6 247.739375 250.883375 PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICE
session4_OV20 1 7 253.731375 261.139375 IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD  LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPELLENT THEIR PITIABLE NAKEDNESS
session4_OV20 1 0 262.643375 267.383375 'WELL' SAID MADEMOISELLE DE TENECHELANT 'I ALSO THINK A GOOD DEAL
session4_OV20 1 0 267.383375 273.663375 BUT I TAKE CARE WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BURSTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS DANCERS
session4_OV20 1 0 273.663375 288.783375 WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTUTORED PANTOMIME OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS HAD REACHED ITS CULMINATING POINT OF TRIUMPH THE THEATRE SHOOK WITH TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE'
session4_OV20 1 1 288.783375 296.143375 THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME HE SAYS THAT I LOOK LIKE A FOREIGNER AND WHEN I SAY THAT I AM AN ITALIAN HE BEGINS TO SPEAK TO ME OF
session4_OV20 1 1 296.143375 301.795375 THE COURT THE CITY OF THE THEATRES AND AT LAST HE OFFERS TO ACCOMPANY ME EVERYWHERE
session4_OV20 1 0 310.163375 319.955375 IN FACT THE SOUND OF MADAMES AND THE QUEENS' CARRIAGES COULD BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE UPON THE HARD DRY GROUND OF THE ROADS FOLLOWED BY THE MOUNTAIN CAVALIERS
session4_OV20 1 1 321.091375 333.907375 SIMPLY BY STOPPING HER CARRIAGE TWO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE THE SHOP TO HAVE HER SNUFF BOX FILLED AND BY SAYING ALOUD TO THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HANDED BACK THE BOX THAT HER SNUFF WAS THE VERY BEST AT PARIS
session4_OV20 1 1 336.179375 338.771375 I NEVER HAD ANY FAMILY
session4_OV20 1 7 346.003375 361.459375 CLASPED HIS HANDS ON THE DESK AND SAID WHY WAS THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST INSTITUTED UNDER THE TWO SPECIES OF BREAD AND WINE IF JESUS CHRIST BE PRESENT BODY AND BLOOD SOUL AND DIVINITY IN THE BREAD OF MAN
session4_OV20 1 4 367.955375 374.815375 WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE
session4_OV20 1 4 374.815375 390.227375 BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD
session4_OV20 1 7 392.019375 400.131375 THAT HE FOUND AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO
session4_OV20 1 7 401.091375 402.339375 IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
session4_OV20 1 7 409.203375 412.131375 STUFF IT INTO YOU HIS BELLY COUNSELED HIM
session4_OV20 1 1 413.683375 418.103375 MY REMARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVED TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK
session4_OV20 1 1 418.103375 421.811375 HOWEVER PERFECT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THAT ANCIENT WRITER
session4_OV20 1 3 431.075375 444.307375 THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE EVOLUTION OF CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOODS OR OF SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MEND THE CONSUMER'S GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES

session4_OV30 1 5 525.919375 528.559375 SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF ANY WHATEVER
session4_OV30 1 2 529.407375 532.031375 KASEI WAS MY MANSERVANT
session4_OV30 1 2 533.935375 543.359375 I WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO SEE MY COUNTRY AGAIN MY FRIENDS MY MODEST QUARTERS BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS MY DEARLY BELOVED COLLECTIONS

session4_OV30 1 7 551.999375 562.127375 BUT HER GREETING TO CAPTAIN LINK WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUGHTY AND FROZEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE
session4_OV30 1 5 568.783375 569.883375 ANGER
session4_OV30 1 5 569.883375 570.843375 PAIN

session5_OV30 1 5 17.08 28.044 AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO BE
session5_OV30 1 5 32.316 52.86 THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER

session5_OV30 1 1 152.924 167.788 IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BEATEN AND IN BEGGARS WEEDS THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES
session5_OV30 1 7 174.764 177.1 BUT THEY'RE FEAR  MONGERS AND A FEAR

session5_OV30 1 4 195.252 204.032 THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND ISHIATED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES
session5_OV30 1 4 204.032 216.732 AND ALTHOUGH THE PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED REAL ESTATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURT'S RECEIVER AND THE MORMON CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGH RENTAL ON ITS OWN PROPERTY
session5_OV30 1 3 216.732 233.468 THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS
session5_OV30 1 5 236.236 244.796 THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY
session5_OV30 1 5 246.764 264.204 BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND UNWARILY FACILITATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION

session5_OV30 1 3 520.512 522.428 THE CALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY
session5_OV30 1 1 531.644 533.004 THE SENTENCE OF ST
session5_OV30 1 1 533.004 544.796 JAMES WHICH SAYS THAT HE WHO OFFENDS AGAINST ONE COMMANDMENT BECOMES GUILTY OF ALL HAD SEEMED TO HIM FIRST A SWOLLEN PHRASE UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO GROPE IN THE DARKNESS OF HIS OWN STATE

session5_OV30 1 5 558.796 575.644 THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTENANCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSED ROYALISTS

session5_OV30 1 2 583.932 593.164 THOU CANST WAIT THROUGH SORROW AND SICKNESS TO BRING SOULS TO TOUCH AND THINK IT SOON WHEN OTHERS CRY TOO LATE
session5_OV30 1 3 5.12475 10.51675 THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS

session5_OV30 1 5 330.21275 340.83275 AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE TEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE
session5_OV30 1 5 340.83275 356.08475 WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THAT PSALM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS

session1_OV40 1 2 511.416 525.176 AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
session1_OV40 1 2 525.176 527.116 THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING

session6_OV40 1 2 79.532 85.632 IT IS SUCH A NOBLE AMBITION THAT IT IS A PITY IT HAS USUALLY SUCH A SHALLOW FOUNDATION
session6_OV40 1 7 85.632 91.432 HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES
session6_OV40 1 7 91.432 101.452 IF THE BEHAVIORIST FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES

session6_OV40 1 5 130.268 137.968 TRULY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE'RE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL OF LOSING SIGHT OF THE CREATOR AND IDOLATRY OF THE CREATURE

session6_OV40 1 7 183.196 194.636 THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE AND VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION
session6_OV40 1 7 194.636 201.736 RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
session6_OV40 1 7 201.736 208.216 WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST
session6_OV40 1 7 208.216 217.196 FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
session6_OV40 1 7 220.62 224.24 THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT

session6_OV40 1 1 235.04 236.56 THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUD AND FIRE

session6_OV40 1 1 345.144 350.476 THAT A STYLE IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS
session6_OV40 1 6 353.932 357.352 SHE IS UNDER SAIL BUT SHE IS COUNT TIMOSHEV'S YACHT
session6_OV40 1 6 357.352 359.032 HE WAS RIGHT
session6_OV40 1 1 359.032 378.924 THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE RED AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS AN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEIZE BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH
session6_OV40 1 4 393.564 397.5839375 BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY
session6_OV40 1 4 397.5839375 405.548 FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
session6_OV40 1 0 427.564 431.132 CRIED THE YOUNG LADIES AND THEY QUICKLY PUT OUT THE FIRE
session6_OV40 1 3 432.044 436.584 NAY DEAR AUNT YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CALLED TO
session6_OV40 1 3 436.584 438.476 FORSAKE THEIR WORK AND THEIR FAMILIES
session6_OV40 1 6 442.028 446.528 THE WIND BEING ADVERSE THE DOBRYNA DID NOT MAKE VERY RAPID PROGRESS
session6_OV40 1 6 446.528 455.612 BUT AS THE WEATHER IN SPITE OF A FEW CLOUDS REMAINED CALM AND THE SEA WAS QUITE SMOOTH SHE WAS ENABLED TO HOLD A STEADY COURSE
session6_OV40 1 5 463.164 466.86 IN THIS MONOTONOUS LIFE OF MINE THAT WAS A PLEASANT EVENT
session6_OV40 1 6 482.412 485.1 NOTHING MORE THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF
session6_OV40 1 7 492.524 509.624 WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORRELATES ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
session6_OV40 1 7 509.624 516.124 IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL  KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS
session6_OV40 1 7 516.124 524.108 WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS
session6_OV40 1 5 526.588 533.648 BUT DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I DISPARAGE THE GIFT WHICH YOU POSSESS NOR THAT I WOULD DISCOURAGE YOU FROM EXERCISING IT
session6_OV40 1 5 533.648 540.228 I ONLY EXHORT YOU SO TO THINK OF IT AND SO TO USE IT AS TO RENDER IT CONDUCIVE TO YOUR OWN PERMANENT GOOD
session6_OV40 1 1 540.228 551.568 YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN
session6_OV40 1 1 551.568 555.036 FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JEWELLER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
session6_OV40 1 5 557.244 561.148 I THOUGHT IT THEREFORE MY DUTY WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL TO BECOME A GOVERNESS
session6_OV40 1 3 564.588 567.9 I OFTEN HEARD HER TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
session6_OV40 1 4 573.98 577.8 AND SHE TOOK ANDERS' HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE
session6_OV40 1 4 577.8 590.492 BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT
session6_OV40 1 0 596.316 598.684 THAT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD
session6_OV40 1 3 3.5 18.48 THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAH MORRIS WITH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARY
session6_OV40 1 3 18.48 20.331375 I HAD A COMMON PATIENCE WITH YOU
session6_OV40 1 0 21.867375 25.867375 TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TOO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND
session6_OV40 1 0 25.867375 28.727375 NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME UP
session6_OV40 1 0 28.727375 35.483374999999995 AND WHEN AT LAST SOMEBODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY
session6_OV40 1 6 40.683375 43.123375 YOU WILL TAKE ME ON BOARD COUNT YOU NOT
session6_OV40 1 2 43.123375 46.043375 AND SUCCESS IN ALL ITS WIDE HORIZON
session6_OV40 1 3 57.547375 67.347375 PETTY SORREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SURFACES
session6_OV40 1 3 67.347375 74.447375 FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE
session6_OV40 1 3 74.447375 82.507375 AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEWTER DISHES THAT WERE ARRANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG
session6_OV40 1 3 82.507375 88.043375 DEAL DINNER TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GRATE WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER
session6_OV40 1 6 98.315375 102.635375 SERVODAK TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE DOBRINA WAS ENDEAVORING TO PUT IN
session6_OV40 1 7 118.267375 125.627375 I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I'VE NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING
session6_OV40 1 7 125.627375 129.947375 AND IT CAN HARDLY BE HOLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
session6_OV40 1 1 135.803375 138.251375 WE'VE SEEN THIS ABSOLUTELY ARCADIAN
session6_OV40 1 7 152.139375 155.759375 THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY
session6_OV40 1 7 155.759375 160.907375 BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
session6_OV40 1 2 163.451375 168.699375 MARK RUFFOLTON ALMOST LOST FOR A MOMENT HER HABITUAL PLACIDITY
session6_OV40 1 2 176.923375 180.023375 IF I GO TO MEETING AT ALL I LIKE BEST
session6_OV40 1 2 180.023375 187.755375 TO SIT IN THE QUIET OLD HOUSE IN GERMANTOWN WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE ALL OPEN AND I CAN SEE THE TREES AND HEAR THE STIR OF THE LEAVES
session6_OV40 1 0 212.907375 215.567375 I WOULD SAY NO IF I AM
session6_OV40 1 0 215.567375 220.067375 DESTINED FOR SO GLORIOUS A CAREER CRIED THE TREE REJOICING
session6_OV40 1 4 220.067375 222.843375 THAT IS COMPARATIVELY ENOUGH
session6_OV40 1 6 236.027375 239.467375 IS IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE HE MURMURED ALOUD THAT
session6_OV40 1 6 239.467375 242.443375 ANY CITY SHOULD DISAPPEAR SO COMPLETELY
session6_OV40 1 1 246.731375 255.611375 AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGY AND CLOSE DOWN
session6_OV40 1 1 255.611375 276.711375 CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CHIAROSCURIST DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
session6_OV40 1 1 276.711375 284.203375 THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL
session6_OV40 1 1 285.179375 292.187375 AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND

session6_OV40 1 7 319.355375 329.875375 WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOG IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE
session6_OV40 1 7 329.875375 340.795375 SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDIACY

session6_OV40 1 2 379.959375 393.459375 HE HAD NO FRIEND WISE ENOUGH TO TELL HIM TO STEP INTO THE DORKING CONVENTION THEN IN SESSION MAKE A SKETCH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE PLATFORM AND TAKE IT TO THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY GRAPEVINE AND SEE WHAT HE COULD GET A LINE FOR IT
session6_OV40 1 2 393.459375 395.739375 I WAS AFRAID IT WAS NEAR HER HOME
session6_OV40 1 6 402.683375 413.803375 AFTER PONDERING A WHILE HE SAID IF WE WERE FARTHER AWAY I SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND A DEPTH OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS INSTEAD OF FIVE FATHOMS
session6_OV40 1 6 413.803375 424.023375 FIVE FATHOMS A SLIGHT DIMINUTION IN THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS
session6_OV40 1 6 424.023375 432.483375 BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S ORBIT WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE

session6_OV40 1 1 466.323375 483.723375 PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HUES IT BECOMES SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUNDED BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS IN THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JEWELS
session6_OV40 1 2 483.723375 487.663375 I HAVE NOT ASKED HIM RUTH REPLIED WITH A LOOK THAT MIGHT IMPLY
session6_OV40 1 2 487.663375 497.723375 THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE DETERMINED LITTLE BODIES WHO FIRST MADE UP HER OWN MIND AND THEN COMPELLED OTHERS TO MAKE UP THEIRS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HERS

session7_OV40 1 0 75.556 77.036 IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
session7_OV40 1 3 77.036 88.356 ANOTHER CASE SAID JOHN WESLEY WAS A LITTLE GIRL HALF  GROWN WHO WAS WASHING WINDOWS UPSTAIRS ONE DAY AND UNLUCKILY FELL ASLEEP IN THE WINDOW AND IN THIS POSITION WAS FOUND BY HER MISTRESS
session7_OV40 1 3 88.356 98.3 IN A RAGE THE MISTRESS HIT HER A HEAVY SLAP KNOCKED HER OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SHE FELL TO THE PAVEMENT AND DIED IN A FEW HOURS FROM THE EFFECTS THEREOF
session7_OV40 1 5 99.468 102.348 ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS FROM EACH STORY
session7_OV40 1 7 103.996 124.556 HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA THERE I AM VERY GLAD
session7_OV40 1 6 132.684 141.74 THE ARYANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
session7_OV40 1 0 142.828 147.804 THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COLONY ARE WITHIN YOUR EXCELLENCY'S KNOWLEDGE
session7_OV40 1 2 151.18 158.604 IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
session7_OV40 1 2 160.012 175.992 WHETHER A GNOSTIC PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS
session7_OV40 1 2 175.992 188.412 OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE
session7_OV40 1 2 188.412 200.86 WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS RECOGNITION
session7_OV40 1 5 205.164 209.276 A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER HIM TO ENTER AND SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED DEAD
session7_OV40 1 7 211.516 223.536 IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE
session7_OV40 1 7 223.536 235.308 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
session7_OV40 1 1 257.41999999999996 261.772 BY THE HAMMER OF THOR SHOUTED GRIMM THERE IS NO STINGY COWARD
session7_OV40 1 0 264.908 272.124 IT IS FOUNDED ON THE ACKNOWLEDGED WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVED THAT PERIOD OF LIFE AT WHICH MEN CEASED TO WORK
session7_OV40 1 3 282.044 292.508 FROM RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH SCIENTISTS IN OUR LITTLE UNIVERSE BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS THE BOY HAD COME TO KNOW A THING OR TWO

session7_OV40 1 4 297.44 309.324 AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENT
session7_OV40 1 6 315.036 324.316 WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH I HAVE NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HAVE ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN

session7_OV40 1 5 335.02 336.62 CERTAINLY NOT
session7_OV40 1 1 344.38 349.34 A MORE DREARY AND MORE DISUNITED FAMILY PARTY I NEVER SAT AT THE TABLE WITH
session7_OV40 1 5 361.516 364.38 NO ONE LESS THAN THAT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE
session7_OV40 1 4 369.004 384.804 IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY TABALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DURABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER  TIMES
session7_OV40 1 4 384.804 400.784 BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
session7_OV40 1 4 400.784 407.884 THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE
session7_OV40 1 1 409.196 429.096 IN DETERMINING WHETHER TWO OR MORE ALLIED FORMS OUGHT TO BE RANKED AS SPECIES OR VARIETIES NATURALISTS ARE PRACTICALLY GUIDED BY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS NAMELY THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND WHETHER SUCH DIFFERENCES RELATE TO FEW OR MANY POINTS OF STRUCTURE AND WHETHER THEY ARE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE BUT MORE ESPECIALLY WHETHER THEY ARE CONSTANT
session7_OV40 1 1 429.096 435.716 HE ACTS AS THOUGH HE HAS NOT EXPECTED US BUT THIS SUBJECT WILL BE MORE PROPERLY DISCUSSED WHEN WE TREAT OF THE DIFFERENT RACES OF MANKIND
session7_OV40 1 4 435.716 452.188 BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
session7_OV40 1 5 453.052 454.348 HE WILL BE WELL
session7_OV40 1 4 458.7 465.564 YEA HIS HONORABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN WE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LIEGE
session7_OV40 1 5 476.828 478.46 THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT
session7_OV40 1 3 484.54 491.74 THIS REALITY BEGINS TO EXPLAIN THE DARK POWER AND OTHERWORLDLY FASCINATION OF 20 000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA
session7_OV40 1 3 491.74 496.26 THIS WAS WHAT DID THE MISCHIEF SO FAR AS THE RUNNING AWAY WAS CONCERNED
session7_OV40 1 1 496.26 500.2 A PRETTY GIRL AS FAR AS I COULD JUDGE BY APPEARANCES A GOOD GIRL TOO
session7_OV40 1 1 500.2 505.38 DESCRIBING HER GENERALLY I MAY SAY THAT SHE HAD A SMALL HEAD WELL CARRIED AND WELL SET ON HER SHOULDERS
session7_OV40 1 1 505.38 509.14 BRIGHT GRAY EYES THAT LOOKED AT YOU HONESTLY AND MEANT WHAT THEY LOOKED
session7_OV40 1 1 509.14 522.044 A TRIM SLIGHT LITTLE FIGURE TOO SLIGHT FOR OUR ENGLISH NOTIONS OF BEAUTY A STRONG AMERICAN ACCENT AND A RARE THING IN AMERICA A PLEASANTLY TONED VOICE WHICH MADE THE ACCENT AGREEABLE TO ENGLISH EARS
session7_OV40 1 7 532.156 538.176 THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED
session7_OV40 1 7 538.176 545.468 TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION
session7_OV40 1 6 554.588 561.888 THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED THE MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
session7_OV40 1 4 561.888 580.908 WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARL'S RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK
session7_OV40 1 2 583.02 586.64 THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE
session7_OV40 1 2 586.64 590.268 DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF PHENOMENALISM ALONE
session7_OV40 1 6 595.836 601.993875 DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICS WOULD DISOWN HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
session7_OV40 1 0 3.5 4.84 I WAS TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND
session7_OV40 1 0 4.84 10.014125 CARRIED TO ENGLAND OR ELSEWHERE OR DROWNED UPON THE VOYAGE IT MATTERED NOT WHICH
session7_OV40 1 1 15.262125 17.662125 SO NO TAIL GOT OUT TO THE NEIGHBORS
session7_OV40 1 1 17.662125 21.102125 BESIDES IT WAS A LONELY PLACE AND BY GOOD LUCK NO ONE CAME THAT WAY
session7_OV40 1 1 21.102125 23.454125 SO IT IS WITH THE LOWER ANIMALS
session7_OV40 1 1 30.222125 32.462125 BUT I STAYED THAT SPRING AND BUILT ME A BOAT

session7_OV40 1 6 146.222125 153.582125 AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IS THERE

session7_OV40 1 2 207.710125 213.678125 THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE PAST
session7_OV40 1 6 222.158125 225.966125 TILL WE ARE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN
session7_OV40 1 4 232.830125 245.380125 THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY
session7_OV40 1 4 245.380125 250.590125 BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE

session7_OV40 1 4 318.350125 332.610125 IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
session7_OV40 1 4 332.610125 343.530125 ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH

session7_OV40 1 6 451.278125 454.198125 THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES OUR SINS AS GREAT
session7_OV40 1 6 454.198125 459.102125 SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SIN
session7_OV40 1 0 460.894125 470.774125 THIS I FELT WAS PAID TO ME AS BEING PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND I ENDEAVORED TO BEHAVE MYSELF WITH SUCH MINGLED HUMILITY AND DIGNITY AS MIGHT BEFIT THE OCCASION
session7_OV40 1 0 470.774125 476.910125 BUT I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS WANTING TO THE SIMPLICITY OF MY ORDINARY LIFE
session7_OV40 1 0 477.838125 479.598125 BUT YOUR POWER IS SO SUPERIOR
session7_OV40 1 0 479.598125 485.310125 TO ANY THAT I CAN ADVANCE AS TO MAKE US HERE FEEL THAT THERE IS NO DISGRACE IN YIELDING TO IT

session7_OV40 1 7 580.766125 585.086125 SO IT IS SAID ANDERS BY REASON AND AFFECTION
session7_OV40 1 0 588.062125 594.702125 THEN THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEADING MEN OF THE COMMUNITY WITH THEIR WIVES WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE

session8_OV40 1 5 8.091999999999999 17.036 THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID

session8_OV40 1 7 59.5 67.692 THEY WERE UPON THE VERGE OF AN OPEN TRAP IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE HUT AND STUTLEY HAD TRIPPED OVER THE EDGE OF THE REVERSED FLAP  MOUTH OF THIS PIT
session8_OV40 1 2 70.188 79.74 ON THE CONTRARY HE RESOLVED TO TELL THEM THAT REPENTING OF HIS VIOLENCE AND MOVED BY HER TEARS HE HAD ONLY CARRIED HER HALFWAY TOWARDS HIS HOUSE AND THEN LET HER GO
session8_OV40 1 1 85.932 88.604 FEEL VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL STRANGE
session8_OV40 1 1 98.108 102.548 I CAN SET TO WORKING HOURS TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE
session8_OV40 1 1 102.548 104.3 SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST
session8_OV40 1 1 105.932 108.94 AND IT CAN HARDLY BE HOLY HABIT THAT ENABLES IT
session8_OV40 1 6 109.948 112.808 HOLMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR
session8_OV40 1 6 112.808 114.988 HELLO WHAT IS THIS
session8_OV40 1 5 143.372 145.572 IT IS ANNOYANCE THAT ASSURES HIM
session8_OV40 1 1 145.572 146.632 THAT THERE HAS BEEN A DIFFERENCE
session8_OV40 1 2 146.632 173.628 HUH
session8_OV40 1 2 176.252 188.152 THIS WAS DONE FOR THE EVENT TOOK PLACE AT A TIME WHEN THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE CELEBRATION OF A MARRIAGE WITHOUT ANY OF THE PRELIMINARY FORMALITIES WHICH ARE NOW SO PROPERLY REQUIRED
session8_OV40 1 2 188.152 189.432 TIME ROLLED ON
