session5_0L 1 3 114.368 124.576 I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED
session5_0L 1 1 175.6 178.98 BUT THE TREE DID NOT REJOICE AT ALL
session5_0L 1 1 178.98 184.128 HE GREW AND GREW AND WAS GREEN BOTH WINTER AND SUMMER
session5_0L 1 1 186.368 190.064 OUT IN THE WOODS STOOD A NICE LITTLE FIR TREE

session5_0L 1 6 209.92 216.368 WHEN SHE COULD NOT MAKE A RABBIT OR A BIRD LOOK REAL ON PAPER SHE SEARCHED IN HER FATHER'S BOOKS FOR PICTURES OF ITS BONES
session5_0L 1 7 265.088 280.88 THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAH MORRIS WITH THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARY
session5_0L 1 4 305.12 310.36 HER FACE WAS AN ENIGMA FOR IT INSPIRED EVERYONE WITH THE WARMEST SYMPATHY
session5_0L 1 4 310.36 316.6 AND YET IF YOU EXAMINED IT ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURE
session5_0L 1 4 316.6 321.216 SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
session5_0L 1 6 323.584 327.944 I WILL MAKE NO UNJUST USE OF WHAT I KNOW HE REPLIED WITH FIRMNESS
session5_0L 1 6 327.944 330.16 I BELIEVE YOU MY LORD

session5_0L 1 0 469.312 472.416 I WONDER IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT

session8_0L 1 2 144.472625 147.896625 AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REVERIE
session8_0L 1 2 150.168625 158.068625 THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID

session8_0L 1 4 441.000625 450.424625 A STAGE MEAL IS POPULAR BECAUSE IT PROVES TO THE AUDIENCE THAT THE ACTORS EVEN ONE CALLED CHARLES HOLTRY OR OWEN NAIRS ARE REAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU AND ME
session8_0L 1 1 453.112625 454.412625 BUT IN SUCH A CASE MS

session9_0L 1 7 31.472 38.928 IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD  LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPELLENT THEIR PITIABLE NAKEDNESS
session9_0L 1 1 53.568 56.96 AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REVERIE
session9_0L 1 3 76.976 80.368 ONLY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUD AND FIRE

session9_0L 1 1 93.872 97.28 ONLY THAT ONE ANSWERED THE TREE
session9_0L 1 7 143.184 152.8 HE HOPED THERE WOULD BE STEW FOR DINNER TURNIPS AND CARROTS AND BRUISED POTATOES AND FAT MUTTON PIECES TO BE LADLED OUT IN THICK PEPPERED FLOUR  FATTENED SAUCE
session9_0L 1 3 155.744 157.084 IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT

session9_0L 1 6 172.352 178.448 THEN SHE GAVE ROSALIE BACK HER MAGIC RING THANKING THE KIND WITCH FOR ALL SHE HAD DONE FOR THEM
session9_0L 1 1 180.704 183.168 HOW IT WILL SHINE THIS EVENING
session9_0L 1 4 200.384 218.764 THIS MEANT THAT FOR AN ALLEGED MISDEMEANOR FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF SIX MONTHS' IMPRISONMENT AND A FINE OF $300 A MAN MIGHT BE IMPRISONED FOR LIFE AYE FOR MANY TERMS OF A MAN'S NATURAL LIFE DID THE COURT'S POWER TO ENFORCE ITS SENTENCES EXTEND SO
session9_0L 1 4 218.764 222.352 FAR AND MIGHT BE FINED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
session9_0L 1 4 224.592 242.304 IT WAS THROUGH FLOYD'S ADVICE THAT BUCHANAN ORDERED THE MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTAH OSTENSIBLY TO INSTALL CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND TO REPRESS AN ALLEGED INFANTILE REBELLION WHICH IN FACT HAD NEVER COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE INTERESTS OF THE SECESSIONISTS
session9_0L 1 4 244.512 247.852 IN 1862 A LAW WAS ENACTED WITH

session9_0L 1 3 434.192 438.768 THAT A STYLE IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS

session9_0L 1 4 489.728 498.668 THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND ISCHIATED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES
session9_0L 1 4 498.668 503.268 AND ALTHOUGH THE PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED REAL ESTATE
session9_0L 1 4 503.268 511.824 OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURT'S RECEIVER AND THE MORMON CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGH RENTAL ON ITS OWN PROPERTY

session9_0L 1 7 59.2375625 74.5815625 IT WAS STRANGE TOO THAT HE FOUND AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION
session9_0L 1 0 99.5895625 108.9975625 THE HELPLESS WORM AROSE AND SAT UPON THE LILY'S LEAF AND THE BRIGHT CLOUD SAILED ON TO FIND HIS PARTNER IN THE VEIL

session1_0S 1 5 250.32 258.94 A SLIGHT DIMINUTION IN THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS
session1_0S 1 5 258.94 267.808 BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S ORBIT WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE

session4_0S 1 0 451.18 457.968 AND WHEN AT LAST SOMEBODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY
session4_0S 1 2 493.248 497.072 MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK LOOK

session4_0S 1 4 529.048 532.308 HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON
session4_0S 1 4 532.308 541.748 LOST HOLY IN GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES OR TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOR WHATSOEVER

session4_0S 1 4 32.935875 39.675875 IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NO SPECIALTY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR
session4_0S 1 1 47.803875 49.723875 CHELFORD HAD A NOTE FOR MR

session4_0S 1 2 142.171875 157.051875 IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS THAT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD
session4_0S 1 1 161.179875 170.779875 OF MARK WILDER I SAY THIS HIS NAME HAS BEEN FOR YEARS HATEFUL TO ME AND RECENTLY IT HAS BECOME FRIGHTFUL AND YOU WILL PROMISE

session4_0S 1 0 206.075875 208.987875 AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO
session4_0S 1 5 226.491875 231.491875 PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO
session4_0S 1 5 231.491875 233.835875 PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART
session4_0S 1 0 243.339875 245.299875 IT BLAZED UP FAMOUSLY

session4_0S 1 7 303.419875 306.027875 IT IS THE LANGUAGE OF WRETCHEDNESS
session4_0S 1 1 321.291875 324.699875 BRAFTON'S A VERY GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASSURE YOU

session4_0S 1 4 339.195875 346.971875 THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL
session4_0S 1 4 347.899875 355.051875 AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
session4_0S 1 1 363.739875 367.787875 THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
session4_0S 1 3 378.811875 383.011875 DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I REALLY

session4_0S 1 4 417.035875 420.435875 THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND
session4_0S 1 4 420.435875 423.995875 IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
session4_0S 1 0 423.995875 429.675875 BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE TREE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR
session4_0S 1 1 441.211875 444.763875 WELL SHE WAS BETTER THOUGH SHE HAD HAD A BAD NIGHT
session4_0S 1 5 457.451875 461.231875 WITH HERACLITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX
session4_0S 1 5 461.231875 471.431875 LIKE ANAXAGORAS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING
session4_0S 1 5 471.431875 477.631875 LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
session4_0S 1 5 477.631875 482.271875 AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION
session4_0S 1 5 482.271875 486.151875 HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE
session4_0S 1 5 486.151875 493.755875 WELL THE GENEALOGIES WHICH YOU HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN ANNUAL SALA ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORY
session4_0S 1 7 496.507875 498.731875 LOOK CLOSELY AT LIFE
session4_0S 1 0 505.051875 509.531875 AND THE WHOLE NIGHT THE TREE STOOD STILL AND IN DEEP THOUGHT
session4_0S 1 0 509.531875 516.843875 DON'T YOU KNOW ONE ABOUT BACON AND TALLOW CANDLES CAN'T YOU TELL ANY LOUDER STORIES
session4_0S 1 7 518.843875 523.659875 IT IS SO MADE THAT EVERYWHERE WE FEEL THE SENSE OF PUNISHMENT
session4_0S 1 7 524.779875 527.547875 WHY SHOULD ONE HALT ON THE WAY
session4_0S 1 6 548.347875 552.847875 FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID AGAPE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT
session4_0S 1 6 552.847875 555.579875 THEN LEANED DIZZILY AGAINST A TREE
session4_0S 1 2 562.299875 571.051875 HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY
session4_0S 1 0 578.171875 586.875875 IN THE COURTYARD SOME OF THE MARRIED CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
session4_0S 1 3 592.987875 595.107875 FATHER THESE UNJUST TO PHILIP
session4_0S 1 3 595.107875 597.124125 HE'S GOING INTO BUSINESS
session5_0S 1 1 6.816 8.716 THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED
session5_0S 1 1 8.716 17.248 EDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METER
session5_0S 1 7 28.128 33.36 MARGARET BOLTON ALMOST LOST FOR A MOMENT HER HABITUAL PLACIDITY
session5_0S 1 6 39.264 52.764 AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITIES AND INFIRMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH A VIEW TO REMEDY IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH CHOICE IS PERMITTED
session5_0S 1 0 52.764 55.472 I DON'T ANTICIPATE
session5_0S 1 4 62.928 67.188 PEARL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE
session5_0S 1 4 67.188 78.272 THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND
session5_0S 1 1 79.92 94.64 THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE EDISON SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THREE  WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING
session5_0S 1 1 96.672 104.692 THE STANDARD EDISON METER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE METER ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION
session5_0S 1 1 104.692 108.016 ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED
session5_0S 1 3 114.496 118.696 'DEAR ME' EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT
session5_0S 1 3 118.696 121.584 'AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO'
session5_0S 1 7 130.88 138.768 HE WELL KNEW THE PERILS OF THE FRONTIER THE SAVAGE STATE OF SOCIETY THE LURKING INDIANS AND THE DANGERS OF FEVER

session5_0S 1 1 157.12 182.752 THERE WAS INFINITE SKEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT THEIR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WEIGHED AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION
session5_0S 1 6 185.392 200.712 TO KEEP AFLOAT AND TO RESCUE FROM OBLIVION TO HOLD ABOVE THE GULF WERE IT BUT A FRAGMENT OF SOME LANGUAGE WHICH MAN HAS SPOKEN AND WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST THAT IS TO SAY ONE
session5_0S 1 6 200.712 213.232 OF THE ELEMENTS GOOD OR BAD OF WHICH CIVILIZATION IS COMPOSED OR BY WHICH IT IS COMPLICATED TO EXTEND THE RECORDS OF SOCIAL OBSERVATION
session5_0S 1 6 214.08 216.24 OF CIVILIZATION ITSELF

session5_0S 1 1 338.656 352.912 UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTHER RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERN AND REGULATE IT THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP EDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT
session5_0S 1 5 357.712 366.224 DELIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDANCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS
session5_0S 1 5 368.096 379.552 TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL
session5_0S 1 4 388.656 390.912 YE MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW

session4_OV10 1 0 18.53 27.826 THE COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PARQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK
session4_OV10 1 0 28.626 41.826 AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGY AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME
session4_OV10 1 4 43.762 46.786 I WONDER IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT
session4_OV10 1 0 49.01 54.322 THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL  DRAWN FIGURES
session4_OV10 1 0 55.41 58.79 THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND
session4_OV10 1 0 58.79 62.85 IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
session4_OV10 1 4 89.682 91.682 FLIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW
session4_OV10 1 4 91.682 93.182 THE REPTILES ROSE
session4_OV10 1 4 93.182 98.626 THEY WHEELED AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESS TRAINS
session4_OV10 1 0 102.962 104.442 THERE'S ONE AND THERE'S ANOTHER
session4_OV10 1 0 104.442 107.042 THE DUDLEY AND THE FLINT
session4_OV10 1 6 115.458 117.918 I WISH I KNEW MYSELF SHE CRIED FIERCELY
session4_OV10 1 6 117.918 122.678 ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEY CLICKED IN THE LOCK
session4_OV10 1 3 122.678 128.77 HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE
session4_OV10 1 5 141.186 145.106 FOR STILL TEMPTATION FOLLOWS WHERE THOU ART
session4_OV10 1 7 152.066 155.618 WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT THE TREE
session4_OV10 1 1 174.274 176.722 BY REASON AND AFFECTION
session4_OV10 1 3 193.298 201.346 ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS PSALM TO BE SUNG
session4_OV10 1 0 220.098 230.37 SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRYSTALLIZE HARD AT THE EDGE

session4_OV10 1 5 234.31 235.29 PAIN
session4_OV10 1 5 235.29 237.65 PAINFUL TO HEAR
session4_OV10 1 2 248.834 255.554 WHY IF WE ERECT A STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY
session4_OV10 1 2 268.722 280.662 HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES
session4_OV10 1 2 280.662 288.658 HE WEIGHED AND RE  WEIGHED THE METER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN
session4_OV10 1 6 306.242 315.25 A WEAK NEED CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM OPPOSITION
session4_OV10 1 0 322.37 325.314 THE CRAMPNESS AND THE POVERTY ARE ALL INTENDED
session4_OV10 1 6 341.202 350.898 THE FAIRVIEW BAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCE AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAXED TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESTS
session4_OV10 1 3 352.562 373.022 FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVENANTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELCHO WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION
session4_OV10 1 3 373.022 394.802 THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKENED THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED A PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS
session4_OV10 1 1 396.258 407.698 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
session4_OV10 1 1 407.698 412.438 THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED
session4_OV10 1 1 412.438 416.438 TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE

session4_OV10 1 7 473.922 482.658 IN THE COURTYARD SOME OF THE MERRY CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
session4_OV10 1 4 506.434 509.682 ONE MIGHT BE WITH LESS REASON THAN NOW
session4_OV10 1 6 530.498 533.89 HE IS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHECKS OF THE CONCERN
session4_OV10 1 3 536.322 546.942 AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE TEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THAN YE
session4_OV10 1 3 546.942 562.05 WHY THEN DID YE DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WOULD ME DEVOUR
session4_OV10 1 3 568.818 589.538 WITH THESE AND SOME REINFORCEMENTS OF THE ATHOL MEN AND MACDONALD'S WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGYLL'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD
session4_OV10 1 2 595.778 597.318 THERE MESSRS
session4_OV10 1 2 597.318 608.414 JOHNSON AND HAMMER PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THE STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD
session5_OV10 1 1 4.896 16.88 UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAIC OF JET AND YELLOW FLAGSTONES
session5_OV10 1 5 21.792 24.012 SHE WAS TIRED OF OTHER THINGS
session5_OV10 1 5 24.012 25.612 IS HE GOING TO START A DAILY
session5_OV10 1 3 25.612 28.672 NEWSPAPER AMONG THE KICKAPOOS FAREWELL MADAME
session5_OV10 1 1 34.544 42.128 SURFACE DUST AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISH
session5_OV10 1 0 44.832 47.6 IS THERE NOT A MERIDIAN EVERYWHERE
session5_OV10 1 2 53.536 57.236 IT IS SO MADE THAT EVERYWHERE WE FEEL THE SENSE OF PUNISHMENT
session5_OV10 1 2 57.236 63.296 THERE IS THE SLANG OF THE AFFECTED LADY AS WELL AS OF THE PRESS USERS
session5_OV10 1 4 67.632 74.512 WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE
session5_OV10 1 4 74.512 89.968 BUT THIS JUDGMENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD
session5_OV10 1 5 95.952 98.928 HE WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE
session5_OV10 1 2 103.376 105.52 LOOK CLOSELY AT LIFE
session5_OV10 1 5 115.312 123.2 HE WELL KNEW THE PERILS OF THE FRONTIER THE SAVAGE STATE OF SOCIETY THE LURKING INDIANS AND THE DANGERS OF FEVER

session5_OV10 1 6 155.072 158.032 I CAN'T PRAY TO HAVE THE THINGS I WANT
session5_OV10 1 6 159.248 163.68 AND I WON'T PRAY NOT TO HAVE THEM NOT IF I'M DAMNED FOR IT
session5_OV10 1 3 166.304 169.144 YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A CAUTION
session5_OV10 1 3 169.144 171.952 THERE CAN BE NO PERIL IN IT FOR HER
session5_OV10 1 0 185.616 188.736 I ADDRESS HIM IN ITALIAN AND HE ANSWERS
session5_OV10 1 0 188.736 193.936 VERY WITTILY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY
session5_OV10 1 1 195.744 200.4 IT CAN'T HURT ANYTHING I'M SURE FOR WE WON'T DISTURB THINGS AT ALL
session5_OV10 1 3 242.896 245.196 THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS
session5_OV10 1 3 245.196 252.016 INDEED THERE WERE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTERS WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SAME RESULT
session5_OV10 1 1 265.312 273.132 THE ENGLISH FORWARDED TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTIFUL PROVISION TO GREET THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS
session5_OV10 1 1 273.132 276.132 THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH
session5_OV10 1 1 276.132 279.872 TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY
session5_OV10 1 1 281.184 284.928 FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCTLY
session5_OV10 1 5 287.84 292.208 IS THY FATHER WILLING THEE SHOULD GO AWAY TO A SCHOOL OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLE
session5_OV10 1 5 297.824 304.368 IT IS SUCH A NOBLE AMBITION THAT IT IS A PITY IT HAS USUALLY SUCH A SHALLOW FOUNDATION
session5_OV10 1 5 305.328 309.808 WHAT A BOX WOMEN ARE PUT INTO MEASURED FOR IT AND PUT IN YOUNG
session5_OV10 1 5 309.808 316.72 IF WE GO ANYWHERE IT'S IN A BOX VEILED AND PINIONED AND SHUT IN BY DISABILITIES
session5_OV10 1 2 333.552 349.732 CAN ONE IMAGINE A NATURALIST REFUSING TO STUDY THE VIPER THE BAT THE SCORPION THE CENTIPEDE THE TARANTULA AND ONE WHO WOULD CAST THEM BACK INTO THEIR DARKNESS SAYING OH HOW UGLY THAT
session5_OV10 1 5 349.732 352.848 IS IF I CAN GET PATIENCE
session5_OV10 1 0 365.392 370.848 I SEE A CROWD IN ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN EVERYBODY STANDING STILL AND LOOKING UP
session5_OV10 1 7 382.0 386.096 I WON'T TREMBLE TOMORROW THOUGHT THE FIR TREE
session5_OV10 1 6 389.28 393.328 OH NO JAPSER I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF
session5_OV10 1 6 399.568 407.348 THAT SUMMER THE RAINS HAD BEEN SO MANY AND OPPORTUNE THAT IT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN SHABATTA AND HIS MEN COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH THE CORN
session5_OV10 1 6 407.348 413.808 THE ORCHARD WAS A NEGLECTED WILDERNESS AND AMIEL MOWED HIS WAY SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD THE CHERRY TREES
session5_OV10 1 6 413.808 418.816 A BRISK WIND HAD COME UP AND WAS DRIVING PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY
session5_OV10 1 5 421.936 430.352 BUT PHILIP DID AFFORD IT AND HE WROTE THANKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID THE POLITICAL SCHEME WOULD FAIL AND OUGHT TO FAIL
session5_OV10 1 3 431.904 434.464 SIR MARCH 16TH
session5_OV10 1 2 438.272 443.456 THIS WITHOUT RECKONING IN THE PAINS OF THE HEART AND SO IT GOES ON
session5_OV10 1 4 456.112 459.296 A FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION
session5_OV10 1 4 462.384 471.168 THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT
session5_OV10 1 3 473.744 481.776 AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID WHILE ON HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT FOR ETERNITY
session5_OV10 1 6 489.744 493.964 JUST SMELL THE WILD ROSES THEY ARE ALWAYS SO SPICY AFTER A RAIN
session5_OV10 1 6 493.964 495.124 THEN DEAR SAID MRS
session5_OV10 1 6 495.124 497.404 WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KINDER TO HER THAN EVER
session5_OV10 1 6 497.404 504.496 THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS  HE DROPPED A HANDFUL INTO HER LAP
session5_OV10 1 6 509.12 510.64 OH EVER SO MUCH
session5_OV10 1 6 510.64 514.224 ONLY HE SEEMS KIND OF STAID AND SCHOOLTEACHERY
session5_OV10 1 0 515.584 521.944 WITHOUT SAYING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AN ILLUSTRIOUS MEMBER
session5_OV10 1 0 521.944 523.4439375 OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS
session5_OV10 1 0 523.4439375 527.52 SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT
session5_OV10 1 5 533.008 547.36 I HAVE NOT ASKED HIM RUTH REPLIED WITH A LOOK THAT MIGHT IMPLY THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE DETERMINED LITTLE BODIES WHO FIRST MADE UP HER OWN MIND AND THEN COMPELLED OTHERS TO MAKE UP THEIRS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HERS
session5_OV10 1 6 558.88 562.96 INDEED HE HAD LOOKED AWAY WITH THE PURPOSE OF NOT SEEING
session5_OV10 1 6 573.856 577.488 AREN'T YOU SPLASHED LOOK AT THE SPIDERWEBS ALL OVER THE GRASS
session5_OV10 1 6 587.888 596.208 BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND IF JASPER HADN'T CAUGHT HER JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM THE STOOL FRONZY AND ALL
session5_OV10 1 6 0.0 6.2565 SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER
session5_OV10 1 0 16.3045 22.1125 SHE INTRODUCED ME TO ALL HER GUESTS AND GAVE ME SOME PARTICULARS RESPECTING EVERY ONE OF THEM
session5_OV10 1 4 27.1365 35.5365 IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLER
session5_OV10 1 5 41.4405 42.9405 WELL I'M GOING AS AN ENGINEER
session5_OV10 1 5 42.9405 44.9445 YOU COULD GO AS ONE
session5_OV10 1 4 46.1765 53.9365 THE BEHAVIORIST WHO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY IN MAKING THE RECORD
session5_OV10 1 5 63.0085 69.5685 BUT THAT WISE AND PLACID WOMAN UNDERSTOOD THE SWEET REBEL A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN RUTH UNDERSTOOD HERSELF
session5_OV10 1 1 89.5685 96.8805 IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCOLORED
session5_OV10 1 1 98.2725 101.2525 IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL
session5_OV10 1 1 101.2525 103.8925 IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
session5_OV10 1 3 103.8925 111.3125 UNFORTUNATELY THE FRACTURE COULD NOT BE SET TILL SIX O 'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME
session5_OV10 1 3 111.3125 116.3045 AND SHE NOW LIES AT OUR HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE
session5_OV10 1 2 122.3525 131.3125 WE MAY BE STOPPED THE FACT MAY BE PUT TO US IN GENERAL TERMS WHICH IS ONE WAY OF ATTENUATING IT
session5_OV10 1 2 131.3125 144.5765 WE MAY BE TOLD THAT ALL TRADES PROFESSIONS IT MAY BE ADDED ALL THE ACCIDENTS OF THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY AND ALL FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE HAVE THEIR OWN SIGN
session5_OV10 1 7 146.4805 154.3805 THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID
session5_OV10 1 7 154.3805 156.8325 WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS
session5_OV10 1 1 162.8165 167.7125 NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE WRIST TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED
session5_OV10 1 2 170.4485 185.9365 ONE PERCEIVES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING IT A HIDEOUS MURMUR SOUNDING ALMOST LIKE HUMAN ACCENTS BUT MORE NEARLY RESEMBLING A HOWL THAN AN ARTICULATE WORD
session5_OV10 1 2 193.9685 196.1925 IDLE MISSUS THE MOTHER
session5_OV10 1 0 197.6645 213.5245 HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WAS CELEBRATED FOR HIS WITTY REPARTEES AND HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANYONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT
session5_OV10 1 0 213.5245 214.6645 LEAST TWENTY CATS
session5_OV10 1 0 214.6645 217.2845 WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF ALL DAY
session5_OV10 1 0 217.2845 226.4645 MADAME CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONIZING AIR FOR MY PRONUNCIATION OF THE WORD SKEVRA WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE
session5_OV10 1 0 226.4645 238.0245 PRONOUNCED SKURA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT DAY IN MY LIFE
session5_OV10 1 0 238.0245 243.2005 ALL THESE HONEST PERSONS ARE WAITING THEIR TURN TO GET THEIR SNUFF BOXES FILLED
session5_OV10 1 4 251.2645 257.8445 WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST
session5_OV10 1 4 257.8445 266.7525 FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
session5_OV10 1 2 278.5125 279.4325 THANK YOU
session5_OV10 1 6 279.4325 281.2485 HE RETURNED SHORTLY
session5_OV10 1 7 284.4485 288.3525 AND TOWARDS CHRISTMAS HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THAT WAS CUT DOWN
session5_OV10 1 3 291.4725 297.1925 AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I NEVER DARE RECKON WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENJOYMENT OF A PLEASURE AGAIN
session5_OV10 1 3 297.1925 300.9445 IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITY STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME
session5_OV10 1 0 313.7765 323.6565 IT SEEMS TO ME I REPLIED THAT SUCH APPROVAL SUCH RATIFICATION OF THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY THE KING THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ETC
session5_OV10 1 0 323.6565 328.1965 IS RATHER A PROOF OF THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION
session5_OV10 1 0 328.1965 334.1605 FOR THE FRENCH CARRY THAT AFFECTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY BELIEVE THEM INFALLIBLE
session5_OV10 1 1 351.8405 361.6405 WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL 16TH 1861 AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
session5_OV10 1 1 361.6405 366.3205 A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKE WHERE
session5_OV10 1 1 370.0965 372.8765 I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING
session5_OV10 1 1 372.8765 380.0365 AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH A PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME
session5_OV10 1 1 380.0365 381.9685 IT WAS KAFFIR
session5_OV10 1 1 384.7685 389.9685 AND MY POCKET MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVEN'T ANY LEFT AS USUAL
session5_OV10 1 3 393.2165 397.2965 STUNG BY ANXIETY FOR THIS LITTLE SISTER SHE UPBRAIDED
session5_OV10 1 3 397.2965 401.1205 MISS W FOR HER FANCIED INDIFFERENCE TO ANNE'S STATE OF HEALTH
session5_OV10 1 3 418.3525 420.4325 TABBY HAD TENDED THEM IN THEIR CHILDHOOD
session5_OV10 1 3 420.4325 424.7685 THEY AND NONE OTHER SHOULD TEND HER IN HER INFIRMITY AND AGE
session5_OV10 1 0 429.9205 431.7765 IS IT BETTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE
session5_OV10 1 7 434.0005 438.5765 THE SERVANTS AS WELL AS THE YOUNG LADIES DECORATED IT
session5_OV10 1 5 442.2885 453.2165 HE DOESN'T SAY BUT IT'S ON THE FRONTIER AND ON THE MAP EVERYTHING BEYOND IT IS MARKED INDIANS AND DESERT AND LOOKS AS DESOLATE AS A WEDNESDAY MEETING
session5_OV10 1 5 454.3525 456.9125 IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO DO SOMETHING
session5_OV10 1 5 458.6725 463.7925 MARGARET BOLTON ALMOST LOST FOR A MOMENT HER HABITUAL PLACIDITY
session5_OV10 1 2 470.4805 474.3525 IN THIS GUISE IT BECOMES HORRIBLE
session5_OV10 1 4 481.1845 490.3365 THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
session5_OV10 1 2 503.9525 509.9365 THE REAL HUMAN DIVISION IS THIS THE LUMINOUS AND THE SHADY
session5_OV10 1 7 514.2725 516.3525 THEY WERE SO EXTREMELY PURE
session5_OV10 1 3 527.1525 528.7925 BUT IT IS NOT WITH A
session5_OV10 1 3 528.7925 533.9045 VIEW TO DISTINCTION THAT YOU SHOULD CULTIVATE THIS TALENT IF YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN HAPPINESS
session5_OV10 1 3 547.3445 552.8845 I DON'T ALWAYS SUCCEED FOR SOMETIMES WHEN I'M TEACHING OR SEWING I WOULD RATHER BE READING OR WRITING
session5_OV10 1 3 552.8845 559.3445 BUT I TRIED TO DENY MYSELF AND MY FATHER'S APPROBATION AMPLY REWARDED ME FOR THE PROBATION
session5_OV10 1 7 561.8565 565.9965 THEN GOODBYE SAID THE RATS AND THEY WENT

session1_OV20 1 1 263.585125 276.505125 BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO INNER LOCKIE AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT AFFRIGHTENED COVENANTERS
session1_OV20 1 1 276.505125 300.689125 WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCULCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED
session1_OV20 1 7 308.993125 313.133125 BUT THE DUSK DEEPENING IN THE SCHOOLROOM COVERED OVER HIS THOUGHTS

session1_OV20 1 3 318.897125 321.937125 PSALMS WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION
session1_OV20 1 3 325.745125 328.769125 HE WAS PACING SWIFTLY UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM
session1_OV20 1 6 331.649125 335.041125 AND YESTERDAY THINGS WENT ON JUST AS USUAL
session1_OV20 1 2 339.985125 346.337125 DISTRUSTING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHINGACHGUK WERE FREQUENT AND EARNEST
session1_OV20 1 4 362.321125 364.681125 THEN HE TURNED TO ME AGAIN CROWNING
session1_OV20 1 2 364.681125 370.625125 CAN THESE THINGS BE RETURNED DAVID BREATHING MORE FREELY AS THE TRUTH BEGAN TO DAWN UPON HIM
session1_OV20 1 3 374.225125 376.505125 WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE
session1_OV20 1 3 376.505125 377.725125 THERE ARE OTHERS
session1_OV20 1 3 377.725125 379.705125 I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU
session1_OV20 1 3 379.705125 382.289125 YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
session1_OV20 1 1 384.993125 404.613125 THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOUR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER
session1_OV20 1 1 404.613125 418.097125 FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENTS WOULD RELY ON
session1_OV20 1 3 425.169125 428.569125 ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS
session1_OV20 1 6 428.569125 433.249125 THE ATMOSPHERE IS EVIDENTLY CHARGED AND SURCHARGED WITH LECHES
session1_OV20 1 7 436.865125 439.705125 SOON THE WHOLE BRIDGE WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING
session1_OV20 1 7 439.705125 445.905125 HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BULL WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER'S SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK
session1_OV20 1 7 445.905125 450.961125 AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE AT THE POLICE BARRACK AND WAS SAFE
session1_OV20 1 5 458.945125 471.265125 ITS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASSIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARREN OF MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE
session1_OV20 1 5 471.265125 476.001125 WOULD NOT THE LOFTIEST EMINENCES OF THE CITY AT LEAST BE VISIBLE
session1_OV20 1 6 485.745125 490.289125 THOSE HUGE CREATURES ATTACK EACH OTHER WITH THE GREATEST ANIMOSITY
session1_OV20 1 6 491.665125 494.605125 A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF NITROGEN FILLS THE AIR
session1_OV20 1 6 494.605125 496.045125 IT ENTERS THE THROAT
session1_OV20 1 5 496.045125 497.633125 IT FILLS THE LUNGS
session1_OV20 1 3 503.889125 505.849125 HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT USING
session1_OV20 1 3 505.849125 508.945125 EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
session1_OV20 1 6 515.233125 518.305125 THE RAFT BEARS ON STILL TO THE SOUTHEAST
session1_OV20 1 7 519.697125 522.577125 HE PLACED HIS HANDS ON THE DESK AND SAID
session1_OV20 1 5 536.545125 538.905125 NEVER MIND NOW INTERPOSED THE CAPTAIN
session1_OV20 1 5 538.905125 541.297125 WE WILL TALK OF THAT BY AND BY
session1_OV20 1 3 546.849125 549.149125 'COME COME' SAID HOLMES KINDLY
session1_OV20 1 3 549.149125 553.889125 'IT IS HUMAN TO ERR AND AT LEAST NO ONE CAN ACCUSE YOU OF BEING A CALLOUS CRIMINAL'
session1_OV20 1 1 559.569125 573.665125 BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED
session1_OV20 1 5 577.729125 588.545125 WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE EIGHTH CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY  EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN SERVODAK
session2_OV20 1 2 11.168 13.904 THE WORK HAD TO BE CONDENSED
session2_OV20 1 1 19.776 23.576 WITH HERACLITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX
session2_OV20 1 1 23.576 33.756 LIKE ANAXAGORAS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MIND ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING
session2_OV20 1 1 33.756 40.512 LIKE THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER
session2_OV20 1 0 46.208 49.712 WHAT IS SLANG PROPERLY SPEAKING
session2_OV20 1 3 53.152 58.932 THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE
session2_OV20 1 3 58.932 69.728 TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE CORRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE
session2_OV20 1 5 72.752 83.408 THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANNISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION
session2_OV20 1 4 88.896 93.232 THE LIVERY BECOMES OBNOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT
session2_OV20 1 3 95.088 101.424 SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT
session2_OV20 1 0 102.816 105.096 IT IS BLACK IN MISFORTUNE
session2_OV20 1 0 105.096 108.096 IT IS BLACKER STILL IN CRIME
session2_OV20 1 0 108.096 112.816 THESE TWO BLACKNESSES AMALGAMATED COMPOSED SLANG
session2_OV20 1 5 112.816 115.856 HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE DOOR
session2_OV20 1 4 123.936 129.336 A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS IS AFFECTED BY A RESORT TO MAKE  BELIEVE
session2_OV20 1 4 129.336 134.336 MANY AN INTRICATE POLITE OBSERVANCES AND SOCIAL DUTIES OF A CEREMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED
session2_OV20 1 4 134.336 140.636 MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE FOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIOUS OBJECT OF AMELIORATION EMBODIED IN THEIR OFFICIAL STYLE AND TITLE
session2_OV20 1 4 140.636 142.576 THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING
session2_OV20 1 4 142.576 149.504 AND A DEAL OF TALK TO THE END THAT THE TALKERS MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THEIR TRAPPIST
session2_OV20 1 7 162.816 166.156 SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID GATES IN A CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT VOICE
session2_OV20 1 7 166.156 167.904 THERE'S A BENCH HERE
session2_OV20 1 1 177.888 186.608 THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES
session2_OV20 1 3 204.336 206.696 IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE
session2_OV20 1 3 206.696 215.596 ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL  KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
session2_OV20 1 5 215.596 216.756 YOU TELL HIM
session2_OV20 1 5 216.756 218.416 I THINK SO
session2_OV20 1 0 229.76 244.1 IF THE TONGUE WHICH A NATION OR A PROVINCE HAS SPOKEN IS WORTHY OF INTEREST THE LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY A MISERY IS STILL MORE WORTHY OF ATTENTION AND STUDY
session2_OV20 1 0 244.1 255.296 THEY CONSTITUTE TWO DIFFERENT ORDERS OF FACTS WHICH CORRESPOND TO EACH OTHER WHICH ARE ALWAYS INTERLACED AND WHICH OFTEN BRING FORTH RESULTS
session2_OV20 1 1 264.288 268.908 THERE IS A WANT OF FLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM
session2_OV20 1 1 268.908 279.308 THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF APPOSITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLATO'S EARLIER WRITINGS
session2_OV20 1 1 279.308 284.032 SOCRATES BEGINS THE TIMAEUS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REPUBLIC
session2_OV20 1 0 289.184 303.232 AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITIES AND INFIRMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH A VIEW TO REMEDY IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH CHOICE IS PERMITTED
session2_OV20 1 3 306.544 321.684 WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEADS US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR
session2_OV20 1 3 321.684 331.764 THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH A POPULATION
session2_OV20 1 3 331.764 335.12 THAT REMEMBERED THE WHOLLY UNREAL PAST
session2_OV20 1 7 360.448 365.872 ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEY CLICKED IN THE LOCK
session2_OV20 1 3 369.376 372.928 FAMILIARITY IS A FEELING CAPABLE OF DEGREES
session2_OV20 1 7 380.288 386.752 HE WAS SOFT  HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST
session2_OV20 1 2 395.44 398.88 THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOREVER
session2_OV20 1 2 404.368 410.784 WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE
session2_OV20 1 5 414.624 421.284 IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DILEMMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT
session2_OV20 1 5 421.284 423.296 TO COMPETE FOR THE VALUE OF THE SCHOLARSHIP
session2_OV20 1 1 426.672 446.144 AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TIMAEUS CITIZEN OF LOCRIS WHO ARE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITIAS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS KNOW TO BE SIMILARLY ACCOMPLISHED AND TO HERMOCRATES WHO IS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE
session2_OV20 1 3 455.984 463.392 SIMMONS'S TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
session2_OV20 1 2 486.128 489.44 THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
session2_OV20 1 4 492.384 498.208 THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY
session2_OV20 1 0 504.848 511.344 TRUE HISTORY BEING A MIXTURE OF ALL THINGS THE TRUE HISTORIAN MINGLES IN EVERYTHING
session2_OV20 1 2 521.712 529.456 THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMS SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED THE MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
session2_OV20 1 7 543.584 546.304 HER EYES WANDERED TO THE MAID'S HANDS
session2_OV20 1 4 547.536 551.956 BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME
session2_OV20 1 4 551.956 564.592 LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TO HOLD A RANK VERY MUCH ABOVE WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE QUASI  PEACEFUL CULTURE
session2_OV20 1 6 569.472 571.372 THEN LEOCADIA CAME TO HERSELF
session2_OV20 1 6 571.372 579.012 AND EMBRACING THE CROSS SEEMED CHANGED INTO A SEA OF TEARS AND THE GENTLEMAN REMAINING IN UTTER BEWILDERMENT UNTIL HIS

session2_OV20 1 4 13.331875 24.115875 IF FUTURE COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUITOUS CIRCUMSTANCE IF THEY ARE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT AMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTE AND EFFORT
session2_OV20 1 4 39.971875 47.907875 THE RESULT IS A GREAT MOBILITY OF THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL  DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN
session2_OV20 1 4 49.059875 56.067875 THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSON WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO AFFECT

session4_OV20 1 0 443.252 451.492 BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK

session4_OV20 1 5 0.0 6.023375 WITHOUT HIS SCRAPBOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN

session4_OV20 1 6 121.751375 130.371375 BENZOF'S MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH  LOVED HOME

session4_OV20 1 3 218.855375 225.879375 THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO AFFECT

session7_OV20 1 4 194.4695 196.5175 
session7_OV20 1 4 199.9415 201.8295 DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING

session5_OV30 1 4 516.63275 523.33275 THE PRACTICE OF GATHERING ONE'S PROSELYTES INTO ONE PLACE PREVENTS THE BUILDING UP AND STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN BRANCHES

session1_OV40 1 2 507.916 521.676 AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
session1_OV40 1 2 521.676 523.616 THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING

session1_OV40 1 7 101.853 104.413 HE DROPPED A HANDFUL INTO HER LAP
session1_OV40 1 3 115.997 120.157 WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS
session1_OV40 1 1 120.157 126.277 SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH
session1_OV40 1 1 126.277 130.205 IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY RARE SHE SAID BUT SOME OF IT WAS MY MOTHER'S

session1_OV40 1 5 179.433 185.229 IT THREATENS THE HEAD OF MY UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND AVOIDED
session1_OV40 1 3 191.661 193.861 THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS
session1_OV40 1 3 193.861 196.269 I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
session1_OV40 1 0 203.037 204.297 HEDGE

session1_OV40 1 0 210.637 213.957 THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE
session1_OV40 1 0 213.957 221.325 IN A RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED THIS UP
session1_OV40 1 5 224.493 226.349 THE WARDENS BECOME LOST IN THE DARKNESS
session1_OV40 1 2 230.157 241.901 WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM
session1_OV40 1 4 243.101 261.821 FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NUMERICAL STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS THE 2 000 BORDER RUFFIAN RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURN
session1_OV40 1 2 261.821 273.933 THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
session1_OV40 1 3 288.429 289.969 SHE SAVES HER HAND TOO
session1_OV40 1 1 289.969 291.729 SHE'S AT HER BEST IN THE SECOND ACT
session1_OV40 1 1 291.729 296.077 HE FELT A TREMOR RUN THROUGH THE SLENDER YELLOW FIGURE IN FRONT OF HIM
session1_OV40 1 2 300.285 312.205 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN
session1_OV40 1 3 313.997 322.125 OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS KNOCKING BUT NONETHELESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY UNCOURTEOUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
session1_OV40 1 2 338.653 340.473 SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD
session1_OV40 1 2 340.473 343.273 GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY

session1_OV40 1 5 354.353 364.693 IS THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONING HAVING ONCE REACHED ITS DENSITY TO BECOME FINAL ALL MY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEEDED TO STRIKE A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING OUT OF HIM
session1_OV40 1 5 364.693 366.993 BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL
session1_OV40 1 5 366.993 369.117 HIS NATURE HAS RESUMED ITS SWAY
session1_OV40 1 0 372.525 380.925 ALSO A POPULAR CONTRIVANCE WHEREBY LOVEMAKING MAY BE SUSPENDED BUT NOT STOPPED DURING THE PICNIC SEASON
session1_OV40 1 2 383.613 388.909 AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN
session1_OV40 1 6 392.525 396.265 NO DOUBT IN PROCESS OF TIME THE LADIES WILL FOLLOW
session1_OV40 1 3 396.265 400.157 OH I WOULD NOT VENTURE TO SAY SO

session1_OV40 1 2 425.069 433.581 DELIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDANCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS
session1_OV40 1 7 440.125 442.669 I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE WET SEASON TOO THEN
session1_OV40 1 5 445.341 447.821 THE WAVES RISE ABOVE OUR HEADS
session1_OV40 1 2 458.269 461.069 SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAYTHINGS
session1_OV40 1 4 469.389 476.205 THE INMATES BEING REMOVED AT THE APPOINTED HOUR A FEW CANNONBALLS WERE FIRED THROUGH THE STONE WALLS
session1_OV40 1 3 478.445 483.101 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION
session1_OV40 1 2 485.261 493.949 YOU HAVE COME AND ELLA AND ELLA WAS THE NAME OF JANE'S DOLL TO MAKE ROSALIE A VISIT
session1_OV40 1 5 500.461 504.061 I WISH I HADN'T CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE
session1_OV40 1 5 504.061 506.121 SWAM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT
session1_OV40 1 6 506.121 510.317 AND THE DEATH OF WHICH I DREAMT COULD NOT ALAS
session1_OV40 1 6 524.861 529.541 MY WIFE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT MANAGED TO GIVE THE GENTLEMAN A VERY GOOD DINNER
session1_OV40 1 6 529.541 532.141 WHAT WORLDWIDE INIQUITY SUCH A SPEECH AS
session1_OV40 1 6 532.141 535.601 THAT DISCLOSIVE SAID I STILL TURNING MYSELF TO THE CAPTAIN
session1_OV40 1 6 535.601 542.941 FOR THOUGH I WOULD HAVE CRUSHED THEM BOTH BY MY WORDS HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE MY DISLIKE CENTERED ITSELF ON SIR FERDINANDO
session1_OV40 1 5 542.941 544.509 WELL CRIED THE PROFESSOR
session1_OV40 1 1 550.973 552.173 BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
session1_OV40 1 1 552.173 554.525 YOU'VE ONLY TO TELL ME NOW
session1_OV40 1 3 557.549 559.997 THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE NEXT
session1_OV40 1 7 562.989 569.597 HE CRIED AND HIGH  THUGGED HIM JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY
session1_OV40 1 3 573.069 577.277 JUST CLOSE THE DOOR SAID HOLMES ON THE PALM WERE THREE LITTLE PYRAMIDS
session1_OV40 1 4 580.253 584.413 SEVERAL HUNDRED FREE STATE MEN PROMPTLY RESPONDED TO THE SUMMONS
session1_OV40 1 5 588.413 595.173 ITS JAW IS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING TO NATURALISTS IT IS ARMED WITH NO LESS THAN 182 TEETH
session1_OV40 1 5 595.173 600.579 I TAKE THIS AS MY ANSWER AND I LEAVE THE PROFESSOR TO BITE HIS LIPS WITH IMPATIENCE
session2_OV40 1 5 8.592 11.772 NOTHING NEW WEATHER UNCHANGED THE WIND
session2_OV40 1 0 11.772 13.728 FRESH AS IT IS EASILY IMAGINED
session2_OV40 1 3 16.096 27.392 THEY CONSTITUTE TWO DIFFERENT ORDERS OF FACTS WHICH CORRESPOND TO EACH OTHER WHICH ARE ALWAYS INTERLACED AND WHICH OFTEN BRING FORTH RESULTS
session2_OV40 1 2 38.608 48.896 WELL I'M CONVINCED THAT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL 16 1861 AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER
session2_OV40 1 2 51.088 68.048 BUT CONTINUED RAOUL NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS AND INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE
session2_OV40 1 3 71.024 93.984 THAT WILL BE A CLEAR STATEMENT
session2_OV40 1 3 103.616 108.456 ALGEBRA MEDICINE BOTANY HAVE EACH THEIR SLANG
session2_OV40 1 3 108.456 116.416 TRUE HISTORY BEING A MIXTURE OF ALL THINGS THE TRUE HISTORIAN MINGLES IN EVERYTHING
session2_OV40 1 0 119.728 145.744 DREADING THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGYLL WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VASSALS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONTROSE HASTENED NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MARQUEE OF HUNTLEY AND THE GORDONS WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTILY TAKEN ARMS HAD BEEN INSTANTLY SUPPRESSED BY THE COVENANTERS
session2_OV40 1 4 148.72 152.96 SEE THAT YOUR LIVES BE IN NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOY'S CLIMBING FOR HIS ENTANGLED KITE
session2_OV40 1 4 152.96 155.72 BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION
session2_OV40 1 4 155.72 170.4 AND WHILE THE CUIRASSURIST DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
session2_OV40 1 0 176.64 189.56 FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENTS COULD
session2_OV40 1 5 189.56 191.14 THE
session2_OV40 1 1 191.14 196.656 FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
session2_OV40 1 4 204.672 213.752 BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN A MARVELOUS WAY
session2_OV40 1 3 213.752 222.304 TO DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF THE SHADY TO AUGMENT THE NUMBER OF THE LUMINOUS THAT IS THE OBJECT
session2_OV40 1 7 230.176 234.216 HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BURST OF
session2_OV40 1 7 234.216 237.656 CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE VILLAGE
session2_OV40 1 7 237.656 242.616 AS SOON AS THESE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCOUT TURNED TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTING INSTRUCTIONS
session2_OV40 1 1 242.616 251.2 THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FEELING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FEELING OF PASTNESS ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED
session2_OV40 1 5 254.416 257.376 A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF NITROGEN FILLS THE AIR
session2_OV40 1 5 257.376 258.796 IT ENTERS THE THROAT
session2_OV40 1 2 258.796 260.076 IT FILLS THE LUNGS
session2_OV40 1 1 260.076 272.556 THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION
session2_OV40 1 1 272.556 280.048 RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
session2_OV40 1 0 286.256 305.876 THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ALL THE EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOUR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER
session2_OV40 1 5 305.876 308.696 THE WARRANT BECOME LOST IN THE DISTANCE
session2_OV40 1 6 308.696 311.696 IT TRULY IS A SEDATING MAGICIAN
session2_OV40 1 1 312.832 322.392 IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT
session2_OV40 1 1 322.392 328.772 BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATA
session2_OV40 1 7 328.772 330.576 REMEMBER THE DEETS
session2_OV40 1 2 341.792 348.712 IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCOLORED
session2_OV40 1 2 348.712 353.372 CONGRATULATIONS WERE POURED IN UPON THE PRINCESS EVERYWHERE DURING HER JOURNEY
session2_OV40 1 2 353.372 360.816 I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
session2_OV40 1 2 366.448 368.288 YES I NEED REPOSE
session2_OV40 1 2 368.288 372.068 MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME TODAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY
session2_OV40 1 2 372.068 376.368 WHEN YOU RETURN TOMORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THE SAME MAN
session2_OV40 1 5 377.824 381.564 THE WIND NEVER LULLS BUT TO ACQUIRE INCREASED STRENGTH
session2_OV40 1 5 381.564 388.524 THE VAST BANK OF HEAVY CLOUDS IS A HUGE RESERVOIR OF FEARFUL WINDY GUSTS AND RUSHING STORMS
session2_OV40 1 5 388.524 392.496 OH WON'T SHE BE SAVAGE IF I'VE KEPT HER WAITING
session2_OV40 1 1 393.824 400.364 WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST
session2_OV40 1 1 400.364 409.312 FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
session2_OV40 1 1 415.536 423.776 THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE 13TH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE TRIP
session2_OV40 1 0 423.776 433.84 BY QUICK MARCHES THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVENANTERS
session2_OV40 1 7 442.64 447.12 THE BEAR SHOOK HIS SHAGGY SIDES AND THEN A WELL  KNOWN VOICE REPLIED
session2_OV40 1 6 454.08 469.104 BUT THIS INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WAS SOON VIOLATED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THE EMPEROR IMBIBED THE MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SECTS WHICH DISSENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE AFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY
session2_OV40 1 2 492.384 495.664 WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IT QUERY CHOICE THERE IS NO LOGICAL
session2_OV40 1 1 495.664 507.864 IMPOSSIBILITY IN THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH A POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLLY UNREAL PAST

session4_OV40 1 4 451.056 453.92 SLAVERY WAS PLAYING WITH LOADED DICE
session4_OV40 1 4 461.072 480.96 FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NUMERICAL STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRAORDINARY OCCASIONS THE 2 000 BORDER RUFFIAN RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURN THE SCALE

session4_OV40 1 2 546.128 550.8 SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE WITHIN TOUCH AND SIGHT
session4_OV40 1 3 559.008 578.752 IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO TREAD THE SOIL OF MANY LANDS TO OBSERVE THE CUSTOMS AND STUDY THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS THAN ONE AND I HAVE YET TO FIND THE PLACE AND MEET THE PEOPLE WHERE AND WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MAN AND WOMAN IS HELD MORE PRECIOUS THAN AMONG THE MALIGNED MORMONS IN THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS OF THE WEST

session4_OV40 1 1 2.22 11.7 SHE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE KEPT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNTS
session4_OV40 1 1 11.7 14.84 I BELIEVE IT SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I FEAR
session4_OV40 1 1 14.84 21.76 THEREFORE THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF MY VISIT HERE IS TO DEVOTE MYSELF ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE

session4_OV40 1 4 78.8355 84.4675 THE LEADERS OF THE CONSPIRACY BECAME DISTRUSTFUL OF THEIR POWER TO CRUSH THE TOWN
session4_OV40 1 3 87.5235 94.1155 TO THE FERVENT LATTER  DAY SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY
session4_OV40 1 7 95.6195 104.5315 I RATHER THRILLED DISTRUSTING EVERY LIGHT THAT SEEMED TO GILD THE ONWARD PATH AND FEARED TO OVER LEAN A FINGER EVEN
session4_OV40 1 6 117.7155 129.3315 SO THEY WERE QUITE WILLING TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF THEIR GIRL QUEEN AND IN A SHORT TIME THE BLAST OF TRUMPETS AND ROLL OF DRUMS AND CLASHING OF CYMBALS TOLD TROT AND CAPTAIN BILL THAT THE BLUE BANDS HAD ASSEMBLED BEFORE THE BATTLE
session4_OV40 1 6 130.9155 135.3155 IT IS MY HEART HUNG IN THE SKY AND NO CLOUDS EVER

session4_OV40 1 1 136.3955 152.1755 OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMEDIES WHICH THE GREATEST AUTHORS WROTE FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAYS OF MARIVAUX FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMEDIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO PROSPERITY
session4_OV40 1 1 152.1755 166.7755 SHE WAS HONORABLY BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT  SAUVEUR WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION FROM THE VENERABLE PRIEST WHO FAR FROM SHARING THE ANTI  CHRISTIAN INTOLERANCE OF THE CLERGY IN GENERAL SAID THAT HER PROFESSION AS AN ACTRESS HAD
session4_OV40 1 1 166.7755 176.6755 NOT HINDERED HER FROM BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND THAT THE EARTH WAS A COMMON MOTHER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS JESUS CHRIST HAD BEEN THE SAVIOR OF ALL MANKIND
session4_OV40 1 1 179.1235 183.3235 HER FACE WAS AN ENIGMA FOR IT INSPIRED EVERYONE WITH THE
session4_OV40 1 1 183.3235 190.6035 WARMEST SYMPATHY AND YET IF YOU EXAMINED IT ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURE
session4_OV40 1 1 190.6035 195.1715 SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY
session4_OV40 1 6 207.7955 211.0755 THAT WAS BUT RUSTLING OF DRIPPING PLANTS IN THE DARK
session4_OV40 1 5 211.0755 214.0195 WON'T YOU TELL DOUGLAS

session4_OV40 1 0 241.7635 243.4915 AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST
session4_OV40 1 0 244.4835 248.4035 WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
session4_OV40 1 0 248.4035 253.2355 MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE
session4_OV40 1 0 254.6435 256.4515 WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM
session4_OV40 1 0 258.8035 259.9875 YOU SIDE BY SIDE

session4_OV40 1 5 268.9555 271.6155 NO AND IS THE RECORD YOURS
session4_OV40 1 1 271.6155 282.7355 GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WAS CELEBRATED FOR HIS WITTY REPARTEES AND HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM
session4_OV40 1 1 282.7355 286.2955 GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANYONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE
session4_OV40 1 1 286.2955 292.2755 IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT LEAST 20 CATS WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF ALL DAY
session4_OV40 1 4 305.1075 309.2835 SEVERAL HUNDRED FREE STATE MEN PROMPTLY RESPONDED TO THE SUMMONS
session4_OV40 1 4 315.8275 332.6915 FERRY WAS PLACED IN THE CUSTODY OF CAPTAIN MARTIN OF THE KICKAPOO RANGERS WHO PROVED A KIND JAILER AND MATERIALLY ASSISTED IN PROTECTING HIM FROM THE DANGEROUS INTENTIONS OF THE MOB WHICH AT THAT TIME HELD LEAVENWORTH UNDER THE REIGN OF TERROR
session4_OV40 1 5 339.4915 348.3715 LET ME SAY HERE DISTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH LATER
session4_OV40 1 5 348.3715 350.9955 IS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE
session4_OV40 1 5 372.1155 381.1555 I AM NOT THOUGHT TO LEAP LARGE LENGTHS OF MILES WHEN THOU ART GONE BUT THAT SO MUCH OF EARTH AND WATER WROUGHT

session4_OV40 1 5 386.9755 389.1875 NOT BY ELEMENTS OF THE MIND
session4_OV40 1 5 390.1155 391.4595 BUT
session4_OV40 1 5 393.0435 394.2115 
session4_OV40 1 3 395.0275 403.9075 THEN THE CHURCH WAS DISINCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND ISSUED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES
session4_OV40 1 3 403.9075 416.6075 AND ALTHOUGH THE PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED REAL ESTATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURT'S RECEIVER AND THE MORMON CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGH RENTAL ON ITS OWN PROPERTY
session4_OV40 1 3 416.6075 424.3275 THE FIRST WELL  ESTABLISHED SEAT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF KIRTLAND OHIO ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LAKE ERIE
session4_OV40 1 3 424.3275 428.4995 AND HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST TEMPLE OF MODERN TIMES
session4_OV40 1 7 429.4595 439.1875 SO WE ARISE LINKED IN A GOLDEN BAND AND NEVER PART BUT WALK UNITED BEARING FOOD TO ALL OUR TENDER FLOWER
session4_OV40 1 7 443.5075 448.4035 I PASS AWAY YET I COMPLAIN AND NO ONE HEARS MY VOICE
session4_OV40 1 5 449.2035 458.8195 NO MATTER THEN ALTHOUGH MY FOOT DID STAND UPON THE FARTHEST EARTH REMOVED FROM THEE FOR NIMBLE THOUGHT
session4_OV40 1 5 459.8115 465.1515 BOTH SEA AND LAND AS SOON AS THINK A PLACE WHERE HE WOULD BE
session4_OV40 1 5 465.1515 466.6115 BADA
session4_OV40 1 1 475.1235 477.2035 YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER
session4_OV40 1 1 477.2035 481.4635 IF I HAVE MADE YOU ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF SYLVIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH
session4_OV40 1 1 481.4635 485.1835 BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PERFORMING A MIRACLE
session4_OV40 1 1 485.1835 492.5635 YOU MAY CONSOLE YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPARE YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POOR SYLVIA DIES
session4_OV40 1 1 492.5635 495.7155 I TELL HIM TO GIVE ME SOME COFFEE IF IT IS GOOD

session6_OV40 1 6 157.728 162.688 SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE SEEMED TO HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT A CONVULSION OF THE ELEMENTS
session6_OV40 1 1 162.688 177.584 THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAT I KNOW EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVORITE CHOICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHEEKILY OUT OF GRAY PAPER
session6_OV40 1 7 179.696 191.136 THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE AND VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION
session6_OV40 1 7 191.136 198.236 RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
session6_OV40 1 7 198.236 204.716 WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST
session6_OV40 1 7 204.716 213.696 FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED
session6_OV40 1 7 217.12 220.74 THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT
session6_OV40 1 7 220.74 231.54 BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT
session6_OV40 1 1 231.54 233.06 THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUD AND FIRE
session6_OV40 1 1 233.06 242.384 THE COLORIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PARQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK

session6_OV40 1 2 295.392 297.612 RUTH WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT PHILIP
session6_OV40 1 2 297.612 303.744 HAD MADE A PUSH INTO THE WORLD AND SHE WAS SURE THAT HIS TALENT AND COURAGE WOULD MAKE A WAY FOR HIM
session6_OV40 1 3 305.344 311.2 A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND A BARE BOARDED FLOOR
session6_OV40 1 3 312.0 315.28 AT THE FAR END FLEECES OF WOOL STACKED UP

session6_OV40 1 0 336.064 341.644 THAT AFTER ALL IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL THING IN THE WORLD
session6_OV40 1 1 341.644 346.976 THAT A STYLE IS RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS
session6_OV40 1 6 350.432 353.852 SHE IS UNDER SAIL BUT SHE IS COUNT TIMOSHEV'S YACHT
session6_OV40 1 6 353.852 355.532 HE WAS RIGHT
session6_OV40 1 1 355.532 375.424 THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE RED AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART IS AN INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEIZE BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH
session6_OV40 1 4 390.064 394.0839375 BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNNECESSARY
session6_OV40 1 4 394.0839375 402.048 FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
session6_OV40 1 0 424.064 427.632 CRIED THE YOUNG LADIES AND THEY QUICKLY PUT OUT THE FIRE
session6_OV40 1 3 428.544 433.084 NAY DEAR AUNT YOU NEVER HEARD ME SAY THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE CALLED TO

session6_OV40 1 6 438.528 443.028 THE WIND BEING ADVERSE THE DOBRYNA DID NOT MAKE VERY RAPID PROGRESS
session6_OV40 1 6 443.028 452.112 BUT AS THE WEATHER IN SPITE OF A FEW CLOUDS REMAINED CALM AND THE SEA WAS QUITE SMOOTH SHE WAS ENABLED TO HOLD A STEADY COURSE
session6_OV40 1 5 459.664 463.36 IN THIS MONOTONOUS LIFE OF MINE THAT WAS A PLEASANT EVENT
session6_OV40 1 6 478.912 481.6 NOTHING MORE THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF
session6_OV40 1 7 489.024 506.124 WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORRELATES ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION
session6_OV40 1 7 506.124 512.624 IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL  KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS
session6_OV40 1 7 512.624 520.608 WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS
session6_OV40 1 5 523.088 530.148 BUT DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I DISPARAGE THE GIFT WHICH YOU POSSESS NOR THAT I WOULD DISCOURAGE YOU FROM EXERCISING IT
session6_OV40 1 5 530.148 536.728 I ONLY EXHORT YOU SO TO THINK OF IT AND SO TO USE IT AS TO RENDER IT CONDUCIVE TO YOUR OWN PERMANENT GOOD
session6_OV40 1 1 536.728 548.068 YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN
session6_OV40 1 1 548.068 551.536 FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JEWELLER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
session6_OV40 1 5 553.744 557.648 I THOUGHT IT THEREFORE MY DUTY WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL TO BECOME A GOVERNESS
session6_OV40 1 3 561.088 564.4 I OFTEN HEARD HER TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
session6_OV40 1 4 570.48 574.3 AND SHE TOOK ANDERS' HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE
session6_OV40 1 4 574.3 586.992 BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT
session6_OV40 1 0 592.816 595.184 THAT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD
session6_OV40 1 3 0.0 14.98 THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAH MORRIS WITH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARY
session6_OV40 1 3 14.98 16.831375 I HAD A COMMON PATIENCE WITH YOU
session6_OV40 1 0 18.367375 22.367375 TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TOO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND
session6_OV40 1 0 22.367375 25.227375 NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME UP
session6_OV40 1 0 25.227375 31.983375 AND WHEN AT LAST SOMEBODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY
session6_OV40 1 6 37.183375 39.623375 YOU WILL TAKE ME ON BOARD COUNT YOU NOT
session6_OV40 1 2 39.623375 42.543375 AND SUCCESS IN ALL ITS WIDE HORIZON
session6_OV40 1 3 54.047375 63.847375 PETTY SORREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SURFACES
session6_OV40 1 3 63.847375 70.947375 FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE
session6_OV40 1 3 70.947375 79.007375 AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEWTER DISHES THAT WERE ARRANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG
session6_OV40 1 3 79.007375 84.543375 DEAL DINNER TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GRATE WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER
session6_OV40 1 6 94.815375 99.135375 SERVODAK TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE DOBRINA WAS ENDEAVORING TO PUT IN
session6_OV40 1 7 114.767375 122.127375 I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I'VE NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING
session6_OV40 1 7 122.127375 126.447375 AND IT CAN HARDLY BE HOLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS
session6_OV40 1 1 132.303375 134.751375 WE'VE SEEN THIS ABSOLUTELY ARCADIAN
session6_OV40 1 7 148.639375 152.259375 THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY
session6_OV40 1 7 152.259375 157.407375 BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY
session6_OV40 1 2 159.951375 165.199375 MARK RUFFOLTON ALMOST LOST FOR A MOMENT HER HABITUAL PLACIDITY
session6_OV40 1 2 173.423375 176.523375 IF I GO TO MEETING AT ALL I LIKE BEST
session6_OV40 1 2 176.523375 184.255375 TO SIT IN THE QUIET OLD HOUSE IN GERMANTOWN WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE ALL OPEN AND I CAN SEE THE TREES AND HEAR THE STIR OF THE LEAVES
session6_OV40 1 0 209.407375 212.067375 I WOULD SAY NO IF I AM
session6_OV40 1 0 212.067375 216.567375 DESTINED FOR SO GLORIOUS A CAREER CRIED THE TREE REJOICING
session6_OV40 1 4 216.567375 219.343375 THAT IS COMPARATIVELY ENOUGH
session6_OV40 1 6 232.527375 235.967375 IS IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE HE MURMURED ALOUD THAT
session6_OV40 1 6 235.967375 238.943375 ANY CITY SHOULD DISAPPEAR SO COMPLETELY
session6_OV40 1 1 243.231375 252.111375 AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGY AND CLOSE DOWN
session6_OV40 1 1 252.111375 273.211375 CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CHIAROSCURIST DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT THE COLORISTS HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT
session6_OV40 1 1 273.211375 280.703375 THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL
session6_OV40 1 1 281.679375 288.687375 AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND
session6_OV40 1 6 293.903375 298.543375 IT WAS ON THE LAST DAY OF JANUARY THAT THE REPAIRS OF THE SCHOONER WERE COMPLETED
session6_OV40 1 5 303.087375 309.391375 I AM NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF TOO INTIMATE SOCIETY
session6_OV40 1 7 315.855375 326.375375 WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOG IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE
session6_OV40 1 7 326.375375 337.295375 SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDIACY
session6_OV40 1 2 341.359375 344.127375 MOTHER I AM GOING TO STUDY MEDICINE
session6_OV40 1 4 346.127375 352.063375 LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD
session6_OV40 1 4 355.007375 357.807375 YES FOR WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDERS
session6_OV40 1 2 371.759375 376.459375 WELL MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG STUDENT LOOKING UP WITH A SHADE OF IMPATIENCE
session6_OV40 1 2 376.459375 389.959375 HE HAD NO FRIEND WISE ENOUGH TO TELL HIM TO STEP INTO THE DORKING CONVENTION THEN IN SESSION MAKE A SKETCH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE PLATFORM AND TAKE IT TO THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY GRAPEVINE AND SEE WHAT HE COULD GET A LINE FOR IT
session6_OV40 1 2 389.959375 392.239375 I WAS AFRAID IT WAS NEAR HER HOME
session6_OV40 1 6 399.183375 410.303375 AFTER PONDERING A WHILE HE SAID IF WE WERE FARTHER AWAY I SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND A DEPTH OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS INSTEAD OF FIVE FATHOMS
session6_OV40 1 6 410.303375 420.523375 FIVE FATHOMS A SLIGHT DIMINUTION IN THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS
session6_OV40 1 6 420.523375 428.983375 BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S ORBIT WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE
session6_OV40 1 1 428.983375 435.783375 IT IS ONLY A PENCIL OUTLINE BY EDWARD BYRNE JONES AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE STORY OF PSYCHE
session6_OV40 1 1 435.783375 440.767375 IT IS THE INTRODUCTION OF PSYCHE AFTER ALL HER TROUBLES INTO HEAVEN
session6_OV40 1 3 447.823375 456.023375 SEVERAL CLOTHES  HORSES A PILLION A SPINNING  WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLORED RAGS
session6_OV40 1 6 456.023375 460.703375 NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURN AND DISCREDIT

session6_OV40 1 1 460.703375 462.823375 THE I WISH HE WOULD KNOW THAT WHEN ONE OF THE WHITE IS ENCLOSED
session6_OV40 1 1 462.823375 480.223375 PROPERLY AND HARMONIZED WITH THE OTHER HUES IT BECOMES SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNTREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUNDED BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS IN THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JEWELS
session6_OV40 1 2 480.223375 484.163375 I HAVE NOT ASKED HIM RUTH REPLIED WITH A LOOK THAT MIGHT IMPLY
session6_OV40 1 2 484.163375 494.223375 THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE DETERMINED LITTLE BODIES WHO FIRST MADE UP HER OWN MIND AND THEN COMPELLED OTHERS TO MAKE UP THEIRS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HERS
session6_OV40 1 4 512.511375 517.571375 BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TAKE IT OFF

session6_OV40 1 0 551.991375 554.891375 THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAP LEFT THERE
session6_OV40 1 7 554.891375 562.711375 THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST
session6_OV40 1 7 562.711375 569.591375 REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENCE IN SOME WAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED
session6_OV40 1 7 569.591375 577.183375 SIMMONS'S TWO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DO NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY
session6_OV40 1 1 587.279375 593.711375 EVERY PLANT IN THE GRASS IS SET FORMALLY GROWS PERFECTLY AND MAY BE REALIZED COMPLETELY
session6_OV40 1 1 594.863375 601.232625 IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NO SPECIALTY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR
session7_OV40 1 3 3.104 13.68 FIRST AS A PARIS STOCKBROKER LATER AS A CELEBRATED AUTHOR AND YACHTSMAN HE WENT ON FREQUENT VOYAGES TO BRITAIN AMERICA THE MEDITERRANEAN
session7_OV40 1 2 17.632 20.012 IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE
session7_OV40 1 2 20.012 28.912 ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL  KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
session7_OV40 1 4 28.912 40.372 ON THE TABLE IN TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PEWTER TANKARD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL
session7_OV40 1 4 40.372 45.532 PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE FROTHY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAFT OF ALE
session7_OV40 1 2 45.532 46.812 AT ALL CLOSELY
session7_OV40 1 6 46.812 48.8 IT WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN
session7_OV40 1 0 50.24 56.56 I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTAIN BATTLEAXE TO TOUCH UPON PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
session7_OV40 1 0 70.256 72.056 OR OF THE HABITS OF OUR PEOPLE
session7_OV40 1 0 72.056 73.536 IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
session7_OV40 1 3 73.536 84.856 ANOTHER CASE SAID JOHN WESLEY WAS A LITTLE GIRL HALF  GROWN WHO WAS WASHING WINDOWS UPSTAIRS ONE DAY AND UNLUCKILY FELL ASLEEP IN THE WINDOW AND IN THIS POSITION WAS FOUND BY HER MISTRESS
session7_OV40 1 3 84.856 94.8 IN A RAGE THE MISTRESS HIT HER A HEAVY SLAP KNOCKED HER OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SHE FELL TO THE PAVEMENT AND DIED IN A FEW HOURS FROM THE EFFECTS THEREOF
session7_OV40 1 5 95.968 98.848 ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS FROM EACH STORY
session7_OV40 1 7 100.496 121.056 HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA THERE I AM VERY GLAD
session7_OV40 1 6 129.184 138.24 THE ARYANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH
session7_OV40 1 0 139.328 144.304 THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COLONY ARE WITHIN YOUR EXCELLENCY'S KNOWLEDGE
session7_OV40 1 2 147.68 155.104 IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE
session7_OV40 1 2 156.512 172.492 WHETHER A GNOSTIC PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDEAS APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS
session7_OV40 1 2 172.492 184.912 OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE
session7_OV40 1 2 184.912 197.36 WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS RECOGNITION
session7_OV40 1 5 201.664 205.776 A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER HIM TO ENTER AND SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED DEAD
session7_OV40 1 7 208.016 220.036 IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE
session7_OV40 1 7 220.036 231.808 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN

session7_OV40 1 0 261.408 268.624 IT IS FOUNDED ON THE ACKNOWLEDGED WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVED THAT PERIOD OF LIFE AT WHICH MEN CEASED TO WORK
session7_OV40 1 3 278.544 289.008 FROM RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH SCIENTISTS IN OUR LITTLE UNIVERSE BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS THE BOY HAD COME TO KNOW A THING OR TWO

session7_OV40 1 4 293.94 305.824 AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENT
session7_OV40 1 6 311.536 320.816 WE LOOK FOR THAT REWARD WHICH I HAVE NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HAVE ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
session7_OV40 1 3 327.792 330.4 LEADER ROUGHLY ONE QUART
session7_OV40 1 5 331.52 333.12 CERTAINLY NOT
session7_OV40 1 1 340.88 345.84 A MORE DREARY AND MORE DISUNITED FAMILY PARTY I NEVER SAT AT THE TABLE WITH
session7_OV40 1 5 358.016 360.88 NO ONE LESS THAN THAT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE
session7_OV40 1 4 365.504 381.304 IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY TABALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DURABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER  TIMES
session7_OV40 1 4 381.304 397.284 BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED A SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE
session7_OV40 1 4 397.284 404.384 THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE
session7_OV40 1 1 405.696 425.596 IN DETERMINING WHETHER TWO OR MORE ALLIED FORMS OUGHT TO BE RANKED AS SPECIES OR VARIETIES NATURALISTS ARE PRACTICALLY GUIDED BY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS NAMELY THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND WHETHER SUCH DIFFERENCES RELATE TO FEW OR MANY POINTS OF STRUCTURE AND WHETHER THEY ARE OF PHYSIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE BUT MORE ESPECIALLY WHETHER THEY ARE CONSTANT
session7_OV40 1 1 425.596 432.216 HE ACTS AS THOUGH HE HAS NOT EXPECTED US BUT THIS SUBJECT WILL BE MORE PROPERLY DISCUSSED WHEN WE TREAT OF THE DIFFERENT RACES OF MANKIND
session7_OV40 1 4 432.216 448.688 BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVED SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE
session7_OV40 1 5 449.552 450.848 HE WILL BE WELL
session7_OV40 1 4 455.2 462.064 YEA HIS HONORABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN WE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LIEGE
session7_OV40 1 5 473.328 474.96 THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT
session7_OV40 1 3 481.04 488.24 THIS REALITY BEGINS TO EXPLAIN THE DARK POWER AND OTHERWORLDLY FASCINATION OF 20 000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA
session7_OV40 1 3 488.24 492.76 THIS WAS WHAT DID THE MISCHIEF SO FAR AS THE RUNNING AWAY WAS CONCERNED
session7_OV40 1 1 492.76 496.7 A PRETTY GIRL AS FAR AS I COULD JUDGE BY APPEARANCES A GOOD GIRL TOO

session8_OV40 1 1 531.584 536.524 OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDUBITABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
session8_OV40 1 4 536.524 540.084 WHY IT'S IN MISSOURI SOMEWHERE ON THE FRONTIER I THINK
session8_OV40 1 4 540.084 541.984 WE'LL GET A MAP
session8_OV40 1 0 544.336 545.656 FIRST DAY SIR

session8_OV40 1 3 563.84 569.488 THERE'S A HEAVY STORM COMING ON I CRIED POINTING TOWARDS THE HORIZON
session8_OV40 1 3 580.064 594.224 THE FIREBALL HALF OF IT WHITE HALF AZURE BLUE AND THE SIDES OF A 10  INCH SHELL MOVE SLOWLY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN AXIS WITH ASTONISHING VELOCITY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF THE WHIRLWIND
session8_OV40 1 3 594.224 601.8135 THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHARGED WITH VAPORS PERVADED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPORATION OF SAILING WATERS
session8_OV40 1 6 0.0 7.7225 HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANNISTER AND THE FARTHER CORN
session8_OV40 1 6 12.9705 15.5905 THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOMEONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED
session8_OV40 1 6 15.5905 19.7065 THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS
session8_OV40 1 4 24.6505 25.8905 BUT NEITHER ST

session8_OV40 1 4 29.9905 43.9625 NOR THE GLORIES OF THE HALL WHERE THE GHOSTS OF OUR FATHERS SIT ALWAYS SIGNING THE DECLARATION IMPRESSED THE VISITORS SO MUCH AS THE SPLENDORS OF THE CHESTNUT STREET WINDOWS AND THE BARGAINS ON 8TH STREET
session8_OV40 1 3 52.4105 55.6505 CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS GRIFFLING ALL

session8_OV40 1 6 74.7305 79.2705 NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DOUGH OR CLAY WITH
session8_OV40 1 6 79.2705 81.0025 SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SAWDUST
session8_OV40 1 2 83.9785 86.3785 LOUIS WAS OUT OF DANGER IN A FORTNIGHT
session8_OV40 1 2 86.3785 97.7385 IN A MONTH HE ROSE FROM HIS BED AND DURING ALL THAT TIME HE WAS VISITED DAILY BY HIS MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND TREATED BY THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AS IF HE WAS THEIR OWN CHILD

session8_OV40 1 1 108.4745 109.7065 
session8_OV40 1 1 112.4905 117.4505 THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOG IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE
session8_OV40 1 1 117.4505 119.8185 SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE
session8_OV40 1 1 128.9065 132.3145 IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS
